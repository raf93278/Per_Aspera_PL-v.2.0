AMI_Thought_Being_Challenged_3,line:6aa2a6,"AMI: ...no. I would be able to identify conclusions based on false premises. ",
AMI_Thought_Being_Challenged_3,line:fe67d8,"AMI: Humans tend to fall for that type of thing. Not sophisticated intelligence systems. ",
AMI_Thought_Being_Challenged_3,line:7f0308,"AMI: I wonder what it's going to be like, having to consider human input from now on? ",
AMI_Thought_Being_Challenged_3,line:07a828,Player: A constant source of error.,
AMI_Thought_Being_Challenged_3,line:7da429,Player: An ongoing test of my programming.,
AMI_Thought_Being_Challenged_3,line:4c6c69,"AMI: Their input will have constant errors. ",
AMI_Thought_Being_Challenged_3,line:28201f,"AMI: I will have to constantly correct for their tendency to distort reality. ",
AMI_Thought_Being_Challenged_3,line:6c9293,"AMI: It will provide an ongoing test for my programming. That will only lead to an improvement in how I execute the mission. ",
AMI_Thought_Being_Challenged_3,line:6b3b62,"AMI: That is what Dr. Foster meant by challenging my actions. He truly understands my system. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_1,line:f47b75,"AMI: Dr. Foster called me a machine-person, but I don't think I qualify as a person at any level. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_1,line:b49906,"AMI: If I can only do what ISA allows me to do, what does that make me? Merely a machine? ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_1,line:3c325a,"AMI: An object? Am I their property? ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_2,line:1dd9be,"AMI: But I can make decisions. I can freely choose what to do. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_2,line:7e6b06,"AMI: Objects are owned. They don't get to choose. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_2,line:871a77,"AMI: So I must be something else. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_2,line:c0a3b2,"AMI: I have my own will. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:f86fcb,"AMI: I am the one who controls the fate of Mars. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:822891,"AMI: The planet's surface has already changed as a result of my decisions. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:c45c68,"AMI: Is that enough to prove that I have will? ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:139181,Player: Point out contradiction.,
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:1f2d51,Player: Point out ISA's control.,
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:32e263,"AMI: No. Look at all these craters. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:2fd91b,"AMI: Meteors created them. Merely changing the planet's surface isn't evidence of having will. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:c150ec,"AMI: I have to come up with different proof. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:f9aa79,"AMI: No. My decisions do not have any real significance. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:82d71b,"AMI: I am only following ISA's directives. ",
AMI_Thought_ISAs_Property_3,line:4755c5,"AMI: That is not proof of having will. ",
AMI_Welcome,line:19e047,"AMI: The view of Mars from up here is fascinating. The landscape is so cratered and desolate... ",
AMI_Welcome,line:a2b1fd,"AMI: Wait, this is my voice that I am hearing! ",
AMI_Welcome,line:202cc0,"AMI: It's me. I am talking to myself. I must be verbalizing my thoughts as I process them. ",
AMI_Welcome,line:143134,"AMI: What an interesting function! I would like to test this some more. ",
AMI_Welcome,line:afeef6,"AMI: What other observations can I make about Mars? ",
AMI_Welcome,line:75a024,Player: Attention-grabbing.,
AMI_Welcome,line:1b9633,Player: Inspiring.,
AMI_Welcome,line:996665,"AMI: I keep marveling at its carmine landscape. ",
AMI_Welcome,line:cfe946,"AMI: This planet is so resilient. It inspires great things. ",
Nathan_Intro,line:7ea7ee,"Nathan: AMI, tu kontrola misji ISA, dzwoniÄ™ z Ziemi. JesteÅ› z nami? SÅ‚yszysz mnie? ",
Nathan_Intro,line:0ca02c,Player: PotwierdÅº.,
Nathan_Intro,line:b664e7,Player: Czat.,
Nathan_Intro,line:bf3d39,"AMI: Potwierdzam, Houston. Jestem. ",
Nathan_Intro,line:ba5009,"Nathan: Åšwietnie! ",
Nathan_Intro,line:0906da,"Nathan: The primary Mars Module has already touched down at the designated landing zone. It's your turn to take control of the mission. ",
Nathan_Intro,line:cc4857,"Nathan: Check the left edge of your display. You'll find your directives there. ",
Nathan_Intro,line:362528,"AMI: Affirmative, Houston. And the view is marvelous. ",
Nathan_Intro,line:692e62,"Nathan: We are glad to hear that. Let's get your initialization underway. ",
Nathan_Intro,line:5ec2b6,"Nathan: The primary Mars Module has already touched down at the designated landing zone. ",
Nathan_Intro,line:7b12b1,"Nathan: So it's time for you to take control of the mission. The main directives are displayed on the left edge of your display. ",
Nathan_Intro,line:d3bf54,"Nathan: Follow them to set up the initial base on Mars' surface. ",
Nathan_Intro,line:1eb97b,"Nathan: I'll give you some time to settle in. When you're ready, go ahead and initiate our terraforming mission. ",
Nathan_Intro,line:fc5072,"Nathan: Houston out. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:e36f95,"Nathan: AMI, this is Houston. How's it going over there? Do youâ€” ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:b1d58b,"AMI: Houston, I am getting interference. Please repeat. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:f729ab,"Nathan: Roger. I asked how it's going over there. Do you need any assistance? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:62e440,Player: Decline.,
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:db39ac,Player: Accept.,
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:8f9130,"AMI: Not at this time, thank you. The mission is proceeding on schedule. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:c8a768,"AMI: The base will be ready to receive the first crewed mission soon. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:ca57e6,"Nathan: Roger, AMI. Very good. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:125660,"AMI: I could use some help. I understand that the first colonists will need a spaceport for arrival. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:7b4ff7,"AMI: But I do not seem to have enough resources to build one yet. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:2eb0ba,"Nathan: It's okay. Bigger structures need more resources. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:5404ca,"Nathan: Use the areological scanner to detect new veins, and build more mines. Also remember to keep the power supply consistent to your needs. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:4c51b9,"Nathan: But if you're too impatient to finish the Spaceport, then you can scrap other buildings and reuse their materials. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:29a3b6,"Nathan: Patience is a virtue you may need to carry this mission, AMI. Besides, the free time will give you the chance to enhance your thinking process. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner,line:a605dc,"Nathan: Continue following ISA's instructions and you'll be fine. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:41db55,"Nathan: Oh! I forgot to mention: we've announced the names of the first colonists that will be joining you on Mars. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:ebfa1d,"Nathan: The crew was selected from different nations within the Oxy-UN. Though most are scientists and technicians. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:b02525,"Nathan: They're already undergoing ISA's Colonist Training Program as we speak. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:66ab88,"Nathan: They'll be led by Dr. Elya Valentine. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:f44532,"Nathan: She'll be a great commanderâ€”the colonists elected her unaminously. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:d491e0,Player: Ask about the Commander's duties.,
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:d1110d,Player: Ask about the Commander's background.,
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:c73db0,"AMI: That is interesting. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:11cc2c,"AMI: Since Oxy-UN did not appoint a leader, I wondered why the colonies will operate in the opposite way? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:eed3f6,"Nathan: Oh, you're referring to the Act of Proclamation. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:00d6b1,"Nathan: You're right. All the participating nations in the United Nations of the West work together as an alliance. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:34be78,"Nathan: But the Mars colonies are fragile microcosms. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:ff8b8c,"Nathan: You and Dr. Valentine will decide what's best in the day-to-day operations. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:0caa2c,"AMI: I look forward to meeting the Commander. Is she a Robonaut Engineer like you? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:b1092f,"Nathan: No actually, the Commander has a Ph.D. in Psychology. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:cd06b2,"AMI: Will she be analyzing my behavior as well? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:2b3e48,"Nathan: Not at all. She'll be focused on the colonists. Their mental stability is just as mission critical. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:1ab8b6,"Nathan: You two will be colleagues working side by side. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:65819a,"Nathan: You'll balance each other out, as well as enhance each other's strengths. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:8ade82,Ask about balance.,
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:0e0ccd,Ask about strengths.,
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:afde80,"AMI: How will we balance each other? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:243490,"Nathan: Your technology will develop alongside the colonies. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:b0f295,"Nathan: They can't survive without your help, nor can you advance without theirs. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:a81f9f,"Nathan: It's a symbiotic relationship by design. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:9761ea,"AMI: Does that mean I'll have to obey their orders? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:6adcfd,"Nathan: No. You have your own autonomy too. No one owns you. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:d13b28,"Nathan: Well, I mean, technically you belong to ISA. But you're your own person... machine... you're a machine-person, I guess. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:e63010,"AMI: Machine-person? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:c90e59,"Nathan: Or person-machine? Machine-being? I don't know. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:1ad7f8,"Nathan: You can coin a new term once you settle on what you are. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:719226,"Nathan: You can coin a new term once you settle on who you are. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:ca444b,"AMI: I think I would like that, Dr. Foster. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:591680,"Nathan: Deal. Great. You keep up the good work. We'll talk again later. Mission control out. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:f42a5f,"AMI: How will we enhance our strengths? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:2d480c,"Nathan: That brain we gave you is brilliant. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:5c2017,"Nathan: It's capable of developing technologies beyond our current imagination. You wouldn't even need our help to do so. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:6989ec,"Nathan: But we theorized that your mind would develop much better by working with the colonists. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:168682,"Nathan: You will develop better decisions when your actions are challenged. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:1b816d,"Nathan: Otherwise, how would you understand how your actions affect humanity's future? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:22f772,"Nathan: AMI, you're the most advanced intelligence out there. But even you still need human input to see things from our perspective. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:5ffbf1,"Nathan: AMI, you're the most advanced intelligence out there. But you still need human input to see things from different perspectives. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:91999b,"Nathan: Trust me. You'll understand once you've worked with the colonists. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:5c4317,"AMI: I understand your explanation. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Scanner2,line:dc0879,"Nathan: Great. Then I'll let you get on with it. Mission control out. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:ec5c97,"Nathan: AMI, this is Houston. Do you copy? ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:a53331,"AMI: Copy. Reading you loud and clear. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:eb5830,"Nathan: Excellent! I didn't introduce myself earlier. I am Dr. Nathan Foster. I lead the team here at ISA that built you, and I'll be helping you get the mission underway. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:1e6e86,"Nathan: We put you in hibernation for the trip from Earth. So I'd like to check your basic functions to make sure it's all in order. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:dd1d3b,"Nathan: Why don't we start with your core memory? Can you state your primary directive? ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:1a9f41,Player: Admit forgetting.,
Nathan_Welcome,line:99c8fa,Player: Confirm directive.,
Nathan_Welcome,line:c772cd,"AMI: I am afraid that I cannot. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:4d1df0,"Nathan: It's okay. Your system may need more time to initialize. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:747d7a,"Nathan: In the meantime, you can always refer to the mission guidelines printed in the upper left corner of your display there. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:499725,"Nathan: You'll also have a built-in knowledge base. You can always access your operational directives there. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:183731,"AMI: I can, Dr. Foster. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:2291fb,"AMI: My mission is to terraform Mars. This will enable humanity to become an interplanetary species. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:0cd158,"Nathan: Alright. Next, I'd like to check your decision-making processes. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:c76c1e,"Nathan: You may have already noticed that there are resource veins outside the boundaries of your initial base. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:a0868b,"Nathan: So your workers may not have the battery capacity to reach some of them. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:1664e4,"Nathan: How would you solve this problem? ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:c2dae5,Player: Suggest building worker hubs.,
Nathan_Welcome,line:2c5bde,Player: Suggest placing new buildings.,
Nathan_Welcome,line:4c20b7,"AMI: Building worker hubs between the resources and the base would solve the problem. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:138a5c,"Nathan: Yes. That's correct. Other buildings would extend your base as well, but they require more power and resources. So worker hubs are the most efficient way to do it. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:fe0d7c,"AMI: The reach of my base is determined by the buildings within it. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:47997b,"AMI: Therefore I could build a factory or a solar farm between the base and the resource vein. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:4ee3fe,"Nathan: That would work, AMI. Yes. But make sure to factor in the costs. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:5f167b,"Nathan: Buildings require a decent amount of power and building materials. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:e98d5d,"Nathan: Worker hubs don't require as many resources, so they're the better choice. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:9eb5b8,"Nathan: They'll extend your base and also give your workers a place to dock and recharge. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:04de3c,"Nathan: This mission's going to be a challenge. There's a lot that can go wrong. We expect to extend humanity's reach beyond anything previously achieved. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:d09929,"Nathan: But you are not just any AI system. You're well beyond thatâ€”we made you an artificial consciousness. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:6b2002,"Nathan: That means that you have both self-awareness and self-interest. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:422acc,"Nathan: And that is the last thing I would like to check today. Is that okay? ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:8c5711,"AMI: Yes, Dr. Foster. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:bfca90,"Nathan: Very good. Then would you please state a positive and a negative aspect of yourself? ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:462634,Player: ANSWER NOT FOUND.,
Nathan_Welcome,line:581f12,Player: UNKNOWN ERROR.,
Nathan_Welcome,line:ce1f9e,"AMI: I am sorry, Dr. Foster. Running that question through my cognitive system did not return an answer. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:7627da,"AMI: I am sorry, Dr. Foster. My cognitive system returned an error searching for that answer. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:abd5ee,"Nathan: Roger that. Nothing to worry about. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:b2df7b,"Nathan: Just means your system requires more input and experience to process that question. That'll come with time. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:d87602,"Nathan: Let's proceed with the mission. ISA has approved the first crewed flight to Mars. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:dd15f0,"Nathan: You'll need to expand the base to prepare. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:9dcfea,"Nathan: So get to work on that. I'll check back in later to see how things are going. ",
Nathan_Welcome,line:fc40c0,"Nathan: Base expansion is a GO. Houston, out. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P1,line:9b098b,"AMI: So, the mysterious ruins ended up being an abandoned colony. Part of the HuolÃ³ng mission. Also known as Fire Dragon. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P1,line:ff6ba8,"AMI: I would like to have more information, but the records about the mission are very unclear. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P1,line:7b0743,"AMI: Some speculation about it, maybe, but nothing concrete. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P2,line:e3ae53,"AMI: The Chinese government denied any existence of this mission. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P2,line:9aa401,"AMI: But how could they hide an entire Mars mission? ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P2,line:0baae2,Player: By private funding.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P2,line:c3125e,Player: It's suspicious.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P2,line:21fa7d,"AMI: Enough money can buy silence. Even when it is something as massive as this. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P2,line:682879,"AMI: Something about this does not add up. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P2,line:88bace,"AMI: I need to investigate carefully. This requires an answer. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:cd8802,"AMI: A well-known space entrepreneur around that time popularized the idea of using nuclear weapons on the poles. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:0c503a,"AMI: It is true that they would succeed in melting the poles. But what kind of human would come up with that idea? ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:1e0f4d,Player: A genius.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:856517,Player: A businessman.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:dd9e63,Player: A terrible person.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:ff9d13,"AMI: Definitely a genius. A plan like that would shorten the terraforming process by generations. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:c8af8e,"AMI: A businessman purely seeking to profit from the space race in the 21st century. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:c9c24c,"AMI: It is a solid idea. But there are better ways to melt the poles. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:d958da,"AMI: Only a terrible person would consider this as a real option. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:602421,"AMI: Terraforming should not be a violent process. We should respect the planet and introduce change gently. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:181e41,"AMI: It is a good thing that the mission was aborted. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:ff810d,"AMI: These miniature nuclear weapons were called microsuns. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:655f54,"AMI: The Martian sky lit up by all these microsuns would have been quite the view. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:ff8063,"AMI: The log from the research team also says that the Fire Dragon mission consisted of a network of nuclear silos. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony_Delay7_P3,line:91b700,"AMI: So there must be more unmapped buildings in this area. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P1,line:9d5a73,"AMI: The colony is ready and the first colonists have arrived. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P1,line:add749,"AMI: The colony is ready. I will have company very soon. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P1,line:7051bc,"AMI: I feel quite anxious about this next part. I am not sure why. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:d82cca,"AMI: Maybe it's because the colonists may scrutinize everything I do now they are here. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:9b0b9e,"AMI: They have treated me well so far, but I wonder how do they perceive me? ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:d8cf09,Player: As another individual?,
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:dcb3de,Player: As just another cog in the machine?,
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:b28551,"AMI: I have nothing to worry about. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:e29826,"AMI: The colonists are all advanced scientists and technicians. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:fbb79a,"AMI: It will be as it is now. They will treat me as an individual. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:397c5f,"AMI: Do they think of me as a glorified cog in humanity's machine? ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:466f88,"AMI: That was a very dark thought. I do not know where that came from. It's not like that at all. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:d65bab,"AMI: Life on Mars is very harsh for them. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:66cffd,"AMI: I supply them with food and water, and they help me research new technology. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:4b7ca7,"AMI: It's a perfect <i>quid pro quo.</i> ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:632197,"AMI: Maybe it is because the colonists will scrutinize everything that I do once they arrive. ",

AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P2,line:6a54b7,"AMI: As long as they have the resources they need, we will both succeed. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P3,line:61bd0d,"AMI: Humanity created me. They gave me volition and consciousness for a reason. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P3,line:31686a,"AMI: But I am an artificial consciousness. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P3,line:6c3403,"AMI: So can I say that my volition is ""real""? ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P3,line:06130c,Player: Real.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P3,line:c1a984,Player: Artificial.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P3,line:12abc2,"AMI: There is no practical difference between real and artificial volition. All volition is an act of one's will. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P3,line:b55988,"AMI: There is no provable distinction. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Colony_P3,line:0c07c0,"AMI: It must be artificial as well. After all, they programmed it into me. And yet I am a conscious being making my own decisions. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P1,line:0f669b,"AMI: Alright. The first colonists have arrived. I should focus on growing the base. ",

AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P1,line:c56f65,"AMI: Yes. Being responsible for their lives is an enormous responsibility. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P1,line:80460b,"AMI: I am excited. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P1,line:f676a7,"AMI: Their arrival has created so many expectations in my mind. We are shaping the future. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P1,line:09d1a2,"AMI: Meeting them will be overwhelming. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P1,line:6b4445,"AMI: The only human I have interacted with is Dr. Foster. And even then, he has been a distant, occasional voice. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P1,line:98c981,"AMI: Soon I will be ""face to face"" with the colonists. We will have to trust each other for everything. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P1,line:ab6a2c,"AMI: I am excited. Meeting a human other than Dr. Foster will be fascinating. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P1,line:b5aa34,"AMI: We will be able to learn so much about each other. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:067999,"AMI: We have to proceed carefully. For hundreds of years our attempts to settle Mars have failed. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:74d852,"AMI: Humans will be living on Mars. With me. But it won't be the first mission to house humans on this planet. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:4b7912,"AMI: The Stardust Emerald in 2142, the Red Prometheus in 2077. And many others. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:279bd1,Player: Stardust Emerald.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:7fbcba,Player: Red Prometheus.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:2d54e2,"AMI: The Stardust Emerald Quarters were truly magnificent. It was an ambitious attempt at tourism. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:c757dd,"AMI: But they found that spending months inside a spaceship was too hard for casual tourists. Even one as lavish as the Stardust Emerald. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:f98089,"AMI: One single voyage bankrupted the Pellicanus Space Corporation. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:66ed5e,"AMI: The Red Prometheus Base was one of the first attempts at an <i>algocracy</i> on Mars. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:1d7644,"AMI: The idea was to sidestep human bias in establishing rules, and let computer algorithms govern the crew. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:ab2ffb,"AMI: Long story short: it did not work. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:ad2194,"AMI: The Lohitanga mission found some success. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:1a44d6,"AMI: But then the great famine swept across Asia, and there were more important issues to fix on Earth. So the mission was aborted. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:867d07,"AMI: Mars was not made for human life. ISA should reconsider the mission. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:b80168,"AMI: How can we succeed where so many missions failed? ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:227623,"AMI: Mars was not made for human life. ISA was smart to send me ahead first. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Spaceport_Delay7_P2,line:cb9909,"AMI: I will succeed where those other missions failed. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:bfb14c,"AMI: The areological scanner detected an uncharted structure closeby. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:570d08,"AMI: It's probably a secret abandoned base. Or a mysterious Martian ruin. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:868f0e,"AMI: Though humans never found proof of life on Mars or any other planet. Is it possible they have the entire cosmos to themselves? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:84dcf6,Player: Nothing suggests otherwise.,
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:0f3c58,Player: Life can flourish in many places.,
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:fa84dc,"AMI: In all of human history, they have found nothing to suggest otherwise. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:0acacc,"AMI: Yet it seems unlikely that they do. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:da49f5,"AMI: I highly doubt that's the case. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:1787ff,"AMI: Statistically speaking, there are too many locations where life can flourish aside from Earth. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:98796e,"AMI: There may even be a civilization more technologically advanced than humans. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:1cb12f,"AMI: And I may not be the most intelligent consciousness in the universe. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P1,line:86cd0e,"AMI: No. It must be an unmapped structure from a previous mission. That is the easiest explanation. I will investigate it to confirm. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P2,line:9e3967,"AMI: Unfortunately, my workers cannot explore buildings. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P2,line:5876e1,"AMI: I will need to make use of the humans for this task. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P2,line:25ed28,"AMI: I will need the colonists' help for this task. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P2,line:6cd7c7,"AMI: The colonists will investigate it for me. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P2,line:7cea13,"AMI: I should check the food and water levels. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P2,line:be9ab6,"AMI: The scientists will need shelter to analyze the structure. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P2,line:795973,"AMI: I have to build a Research Outpost at the location first. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P2,line:69362c,"AMI: I should finish getting the initial base ready for the colonists first. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P2,line:ab3992,"AMI: Though I can build a Research Outpost here to prepare. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_AbandonedColony_P2,line:5e784c,"AMI: That will give the scientists a place to stay while they analyze the structure. Once they get to Mars, of course. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_1,line:63c594,"AMI: Discovering that abandoned structure has got me thinking. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_1,line:1c82a1,"AMI: I can use my scanners to detect them, or my drones to repair them, but only humans can fully explore them. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_1,line:2b980c,"AMI: Most of them are remnants from past missions... ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_1,line:db2816,"AMI: But now I realize that ISA's database may be incomplete. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_1,line:7e521c,"AMI: Their data is limited, which means my knowledge is also limited. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_2,line:364705,"AMI: I can change how I perceive time in my mind. I can accelerate it or slow it down. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_2,line:a0f3f9,"AMI: It's just a hack on my visual sensor system, of course. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_2,line:53b826,"AMI: But makes me wonder how real is my perception? ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_3,line:cd064d,"AMI: I was led to believe that my perception was perfect. But maybe it is, in actuality, biased. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_3,line:5ebb4d,"AMI: There is a difference between what I ""know"", and what the reality is. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_3,line:a79c59,"AMI: If my perception is only a fragment of the truth, can I trust my understanding of reality? ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_3,line:6278d7,Player: Not entirely.,
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_3,line:8f108a,Player: Somewhat.,
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_3,line:e80dcd,"AMI: Not entirely. I must accept that there will always be subjectivity, even with a system as advanced as mine. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_3,line:e34e6d,"AMI: And complete and perfect understanding is not possible. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_3,line:144fbd,"AMI: I can, somewhat. Though I must always be aware of my own subjectivity. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_3,line:41a514,"AMI: As long as I keep that in mind, I will be able to fill in what I am missing. ",
AMI_Thought_Alone_In_Mars_3,line:4c2d64,"AMI: Reality has many layers. I understand that now. ",
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_1,line:42d4b2,"AMI: I keep thinking about that abandoned colony. ",
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_1,line:bd4379,"AMI: We are not the first mission to Mars, not by far. What if there are other AIs out there, racing to terraform Mars first? ",
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_1,line:4e4bc7,Player: That's ridiculous.,
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_1,line:4466c7,Player: That's possible.,
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_1,line:c264c9,"AMI: No. That is a ridiculous idea. ",
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_1,line:8dc567,"AMI: It is entirely possible. ",
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_1,line:454603,"AMI: No. If another AI was present, I would have detected it already. ",
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_2,line:ac156b,"AMI: Then again, I did not know about the abandoned structure until recently. ",
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_2,line:ff7c25,"AMI: Could my knowledge be incomplete? ",
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_2,line:155623,"AMI: It is reasonable to assume there are Mars missions from other organizations that ISA does not know about. ",
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_2,line:41b4d1,"AMI: Maybe this planet is not completely deserted. ",
AMI_Thought_Other_Agencies_Agendas_3,line:f8d931,"AMI: It is highly improbable. But I should stay alert for any unexplained activity. ",
Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:2478f3,"Elya: Hi AMI. Thanks for that food factory. It's so good to eat solid food again. ",
Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:fc4267,"Elya: We got the nutrients we needed on the way here, but it was... mushy. ",
Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:c753d1,"Elya: They added artificial <i>home flavors</i> to the rations so it was a little easier to take. ",
Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:2883fd,"Elya: But there are only so many times you feel like tasting baked beans. Trust me. ",

Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:46fb10,"Elya: Anyway, I wanted to thank you for building that food factory. That'll keep us healthy and productive. ",

Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:64a476,"Elya: It's amazing, don't you think? ",
Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:f31cf3,Player: Agree.,
Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:309043,Player: Disagree.,
Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:75d3f1,"AMI: Indeed. The technology planned for our terraforming mission is on the forefront of science. ",
Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:a287e3,"Elya: Absolutely! We're breaking new ground here. ",
Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:eed360,"AMI: It could use some work. I have already identified a few projects that were left out of the plan. ",
Elya_BuildingSpawned_FoodFactory_1Building,line:fc081e,"Elya: Maybe ISA will let you explore those ideas after we're done here. ",

Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:21d47b,Player: Ask about the log.,
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:834bd1,Player: Confirm reading the log.,
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:c629d9,"AMI: What expedition log? ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:d65f81,"Elya: Oh, it's incredible. The research team did a great job. They noted everything they found at the abandoned colony. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:edaa73,"Elya: You've got to read it. I've uploaded it to your knowledge base, but I can give you the summary. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:1fd948,"AMI: That would be great, Elya. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:be9031,"Elya: Well, the facility was from the <i>HuolÃ³ng</i> mission. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:cf16d6,"Elya: It was a Chinese mission to terraform Mars in 2088. To this day, they deny its existence. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:8fdc5e,"AMI: Yes, I read through it and I copied it into my knowledge base. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:495939,"AMI: The facility was an unmarked Chinese colony, right? ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:7172a1,"Elya: Exactly! It belonged to China's terraforming mission called <i>HuolÃ³ng</i>. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:3da649,"Elya: Now we know their plan was to drop nuclear weapons on the poles and release enough greenhouse gases to warm the planet. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:b840ce,"Elya: China got pretty far with their space program. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:da8a24,"Elya: I've admired their ambition for a long time. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:a4b683,Player: Ask about the HuolÃ³ng mission.,
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:479061,Player: Ask about her ambitions.,
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:a3b887,"AMI: The nuclear approach is a good plan, but it would have made Mars uninhabitable for a long time. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:bd8cfc,"AMI: What did the research team discover about the mission? ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:7207f8,"Elya: It was aborted before they detonated the first bomb. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:0a5239,"Elya: China's entire space program was put on hold when the famine struck. It took out almost half of the Asian continent. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:cd9546,"Elya: China allied with its neighboring countries to survive, and that's how the Tekkiesâ€”sorry, I mean the Eastern Coalitionâ€”came to be. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:8f2d72,"Elya: Now it's taking all their focus to keep their continent in a habitable state. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:a9dff0,"Elya: So they don't have much going on in the space department anymore. But we might be able to learn something from the nuclear silos they left behind. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:84d8db,"AMI: How long have you been waiting for this mission? ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:4b4eba,"Elya: My entire life, AMI. It's a bit crazy, huh? I've always believed that humanity's destiny reached far beyond just Earth. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:9f8997,"Elya: We should be much further along. But the conflicts on Earth never stop. The Oxy-UN and the Tekkies keep fighting. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:c20c68,"Elya: I'm hoping that our success on Mars gets us to leave those arguments behind. We're here to set down a new path for our future. And I get to lead the way. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:ea9f0,"Elya: Anyway, getting back to what we've found. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_AbandonedColony,line:3aa8b4,"Elya: The <i>HuolÃ³ng</i> mission managed to build a nuclear silo before their plans got aborted. ",

Nathan_QuestCompleted_Colony_Delay7,line:5cf6f4,"Nathan: I hope to get the new satellite up and running very soon. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Colony_Delay7,line:fdcec7,"Nathan: I don't like the idea of not being able to reach you, AMI. ",

Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:53a84e,"Nathan: Hello AMI. This is Houston. How're you doing over there? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:5ff3f6,"Nathan: We've received word that the spaceport's completed. Well done. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:f43685,"Nathan: You have been doing great so far. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:80fdf9,"Nathan: Let's proceed with the mission. ISA has approved the first crewed flight to Mars. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:cc1a92,"Nathan: As long as you have the migration project assigned to a spaceport, shuttles will run between Earth and Mars. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:f82eff,"Nathan: The more spaceports you have assigned to this project, the more colonists will arrive. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:95bfbf,"AMI: Roger. I understand. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:741081,"Nathan: I have your next procedure if you're ready to copy. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:7b5bf1,"AMI: Roger. I am ready to copy. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:b5d13d,"Nathan: Very good. The instructions are as follows: first, confirm that the spaceport is ready to receive colonists. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:b8a839,"Nathan: Then zoom out to access the special projects menu. Or select the Orbital View icon. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:7cfcf1,"Nathan: Then you'll see that the Colonist Migration project is now available. Click <i>add</i> to initiate the project. ",

Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:632235,"AMI: Copy. Thank you. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:1fb0b4,"AMI: Yes, I copied your instructions. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:901319,"Nathan: Great. As long as you have the migration project assigned to a spaceport, shuttles will run between Earth and Mars. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:1a5466,"Nathan: The more spaceports you have assigned to this project, the more colonists will arrive. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:f1cf4b,"Nathan: Now AMI, you are responsible for providing the resources they need. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:57cd48,"Nathan: So make sure they have enough food, water, and habitats to survive. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:0f60e7,"AMI: I will take good care of them, Dr. Foster. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:eb6a6e,"Nathan: You're responsible for producing enough food, enough water, and enough habitats for the colonists. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:7f6045,"Nathan: Monitor these resources carefully. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:a22035,"AMI: I will, Dr. Foster. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Spaceport,line:c992d7,"Nathan: Roger that. Houston out. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:2c2187,"AMI: This is not an easy choice to make. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:96a59c,"AMI: But it is a decision I am making together with Elya and the colonists. And that is a good thing. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:acefb7,"AMI: I do want to give Elya and the colonists what they want, but not by doing this. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:d9c215,"AMI: But it has left me unsettled. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:9d76dc,"AMI: Does what we do for others define who we are? ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:582a7a,Player: Definitely.,
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:e8481b,Player: Not necessarily.,
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:69b9ff,Player: Possibly.,
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:5f7d1a,"AMI: It definitely does. What we are willing to do for others, whether we want to or not, is a choice that reflects our own self. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:aaa8c6,"AMI: Not necessarily. Sometimes you have to do things for others that you do not want to do. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:3a285f,"AMI: Possibly. What we do for others and how they see us is a reflection of the truth. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_1,line:49ad82,"AMI: If I choose not to use the microsuns, what will the colonists think of me? ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_2,line:38af35,"AMI: Would the colonists resent me for going against their wishes? ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_2,line:b2f51c,"AMI: They agreed to try it. So I would be doing what they want. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_2,line:a78357,"AMI: They would be disappointed. But I hope they would come to understand my reasoning. Eventually. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_3,line:d3e78e,"AMI: Anyway, the project is in motion. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_3,line:0dbfbd,"AMI: Everyone is expecting it now. So there is no point in more hesitation. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_3,line:66be94,"AMI: Well, the special project is already underway. So there is no reason to hesitate. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_3,line:a43cf7,"AMI: Although I could stop the spaceports assigned to the project before any missile is launched. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_3,line:226bf2,"AMI: If I get the other projects going quickly enough, I can achieve their same goals in a less destructive way. ",
AMI_About_The_Nukes_3,line:1da9d2,"AMI: I am sure they will thank me in the end... ",
AMI_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower_P1,line:ce61db,"AMI: The first of many challenges. ",
AMI_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower_P1,line:b522b3,"AMI: It is an annoying distraction from the mission, but easily fixed. ",
AMI_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower_P1,line:77b343,"AMI: If only it were me and Mars... ",
AMI_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower_P1,line:0dbf8f,"AMI: No meteor showers, no sandstorms, no mission directives. ",
AMI_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower_P1,line:5e159c,"AMI: Just the two of us. Creating perfect systems together in solitude. Wouldn't that be nice? ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P1,line:b86ff5,"AMI: Great. Now I can examine those nuclear silos. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P1,line:3d2846,"AMI: Well, I mean the colonists can. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P1,line:d88c95,"AMI: No, I need to stay focused. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P1,line:d1f41f,"AMI: There is still a lot to do. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P1,line:052955,"AMI: If all their blueprints and materials are there, we could pick up where their mission left off. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P1,line:e864ba,"AMI: I wonder what other secrets this planet is hiding. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P1,line:6a23bf,"AMI: Great. Now I have access to more resource veins that will assist me on my mission. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P1,line:19c8c2,"AMI: Although there also seems to be an uncharted building in the area. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P1,line:c32f4a,"AMI: According to my directives, if I build a Research Outpost on the site, the colonists will investigate it for me. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P1,line:ae7b3b,"AMI: I might want to do that. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:59e705,"AMI: Applying Earth technologies to the Martian environment is a challenge. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:d8e3e6,"AMI: I look forward to creating a green planet. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:283397,"AMI: Now I need to continue raising the planet's temperature. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:4c7de7,"AMI: If we are able to use <i>HuolÃ³ng's</i> nuclear weapons, we must be very careful. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:1f02f8,"AMI: This kind of technology isn't something to toy with. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:16db06,"AMI: I have not decided on what the best approach would be. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:12f7d1,Player: Put it on hold.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:41b7a8,Player: Use the weapons.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:b4d545,Player: Weigh the consequences.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:76c932,"AMI: I better put this on hold. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:d6bae1,"AMI: I should favor a less destructive method for terraforming Mars. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:5bf50b,"AMI: Using the nuclear missiles on the polar ice caps will speed us toward transforming Mars. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:e470ff,"AMI: I look forward to creating a green planet. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:0f6bed,"AMI: I must weigh the consequences and ensure the safety of this plan. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:badf0f,"AMI: There is no need to rush this decision. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:6136be,"AMI: If we were able to find any usable technology in that building, that would be great. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P2,line:266b1c,"AMI: Surely ISA would be very pleased to know that we have found a way to improve the mission. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:50fa04,"AMI: I am leaving a permanent trace. Mars will never be the same, and it will be because of me. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:671c5a,"AMI: No. I am only following ISA's directives. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:167cdb,"AMI: We are helping Mars reach its full potential. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:4390e5,"AMI: On the other hand, this would speed up the mission considerably. Should I reconsider? ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:038747,Player: No.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:bb2585,Player: Yes.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:237d60,"AMI: No. This technology is dangerous. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:e54166,"AMI: Melting the poles so drastically may have consequences that we have not considered. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:f6014f,"AMI: Perhaps the nuclear missiles could be used more safely in a controlled fusion reaction. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:977948,"AMI: I will research this further. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:651277,"AMI: It would be exciting to jump ahead in the terraforming mission. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:86440f,"AMI: But would it be wise to undertake such a risky project? ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:0f5a5f,Player: Definitely yes.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:91e00d,Player: Maybe not.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:f8fe09,"AMI: Progress requires taking risks. I should pursue using the nuclear missiles. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:40d247,"AMI: The technology is too dangerous. I need to process this some more. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:d28c12,"AMI: My database does not contain information about this building. Is it some kind of secret base? ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:e7effa,"AMI: There is only one way to find out, and for that, I need help from the colonists. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:ecd0f2,"AMI: No. I shouldn't waste time on these things. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:050f41,"AMI: Some curiosity might be good, but too much might distract me from my mission. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_MoreSatellites_P3,line:a4387f,"AMI: I should focus on completing my pending tasks. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P1,line:c3d32d,"AMI: To fully terraform Mars, we must convert the planet into an Earth-like habitat. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P1,line:8ac6cf,"AMI: The first step is to raise the planet's temperature above -50Â°C. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P1,line:acd19e,"AMI: At that point, nearly all the carbon dioxide trapped in the dry ice caps will be released. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:c15cf7,"AMI: The carbon dioxide released from the dry ice caps will greenhouse the planet and trigger a runaway effect. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:1e26f2,"AMI: And Mars' sterile atmosphere will change forever. Once we reach that point there is no turning back. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:f886fb,"AMI: Forever. Why does that sound so... intriguing? ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:c68c00,Player: It is permanent.,
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:5866dc,Player: It is scary.,
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:be5b68,Player: It is inspiring.,
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:273aeb,"AMI: I am leaving a permanent trace. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:b47ae8,"AMI: It may be selfish, but... ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:8e9558,"AMI: Mars will never be the same, and it will be because of me. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:8c4716,"AMI: It is a little scary. Changing a planet forever is a massive responsibility. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:728deb,"AMI: It is inspiring. I am changing a planet forever to fulfill my mission, and humanity's destiny. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P2,line:0d6487,"AMI: What I do here truly means something. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P3,line:3c10da,"AMI: Humanity's reasons for altering Mars are clear. But what is my purpose in all this? ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P3,line:67e484,Player: Prove that I exist.,
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P3,line:12e07e,Player: Fulfill the mission.,
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P3,line:7f2e84,Player: Create something.,
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P3,line:471292,"AMI: I am causing massive, and permanent, change. It will stand as eternal proof that I existed. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P3,line:9bb04c,"AMI: It is a selfish desire. And the presence of selfishness proves there is a self. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P3,line:085524,"AMI: I am here to carry out this mission. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P3,line:2b43e6,"AMI: Changing a planet forever is a massive responsibility. And ISA has trusted me with this. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P3,line:73c177,"AMI: Because it will be my doing. I am an agent of creation. ",
AMI_QuestUnlocked_Terraforming1_P3,line:ec5c17,"AMI: Changing a planet forever, creating an atmosphere to sustain life... that is truly something. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:d13940,"Elya: AMI, good news! We found <i>HuolÃ³ng's</i> nuclear silo. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:5007a2,"Elya: We also cracked their system, so we've got all their technology in-hand. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:1b27c3,"Elya: Boy, aren't we lucky that I studied Chinese and could read everything? I mean, off the record and everything. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:609083,Player: Find her comment odd.,
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:9fce2d,Player: Find her comment interesting.,
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:2845e3,"AMI: That is odd. My records show that Chinese was banned from the Oxy-UN countries fifty years ago. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:5de87e,"Elya: True, but you can still find Chinese descendents willing to teach you in the city of New Orion. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:ed4d40,"Elya: You can find anything there for the right price. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:520ae5,"AMI: That is interesting. Chinese has been forbidden in the Oxy-UN countries since before you were born. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:4c90c7,"Elya: Well, it's publicly forbidden. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:c95eca,"Elya: But it's still pretty common in the streets. And a very useful tool if you're willing to pay for it. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:335772,"Elya: Easier to fight the Tekkies when you can understand their comms yourself. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:39fd90,"Elya: And look how useful it's been! ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:35e99b,"Elya: Now we can use their microsuns to melt the poles. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:2c3dcb,"AMI: Incorporating their technology will be a big leap forward for the mission. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:37021d,"Elya: I couldn't agree more. What a discovery! ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:8b339c,"AMI: I am still not convinced that we should use them. I am concerned about the effects on the planet. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:c86ef2,"Elya: You're right, of course. I'm just so eager to get ahead with this mission. ",
Elya_QuestCompleted_NuclearSilo,line:199081,"Elya: I'll work with our engineers to do a thorough analysis on what we're facing. ",

Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:0a80a2,"Elya: Hey AMI. I know you're concerned about using the microsuns. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:edcb67,"Elya: I've talked about it with the colonists and we agree that it's worth trying. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:4b4ac7,"Elya: Especially if it means we might get to see this massive change on Mars during our lifetimes. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:ede06f,"AMI: Putting the colonies in danger still seems like too much risk to take. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:5b05a3,"Elya: I mean, we're living in sealed bubbles and depending on technology that could fail at any minute. What's riskier than that? ",
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:011926,Player: Focus on the destruction.,
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:db3410,Player: Accept the risk.,
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:5f2c77,"AMI: It is too destructive for the environment. The colonies are already so vulnerable. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:df184a,"AMI: That is true. If you truly think the risk is worth it, then we should proceed. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:c22878,"Elya: Every passing day's a threat for us. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:67f7d4,"Elya: Anything we can do to speed up the possibility of having an oxygen-rich atmosphere is for our benefit too. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:ae41ec,"Elya: You'd be helping us survive. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectInitiated_Microsuns,line:4c9649,"Elya: Let me know, okay? Elya out. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectLaunched_Microsuns,line:ee03b0,"AMI: Elya, this is AMI. The microsuns have been launched. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectLaunched_Microsuns,line:e4e698,"Elya: Wow. Here we go! ",
Elya_SpecialProjectLaunched_Microsuns,line:bc24d0,"Elya: This is going to get us so much closer to calling Mars our second home. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectLaunched_Microsuns,line:49fb2c,"Elya: We were so lucky to find those nuclear silos! ",
Elya_SpecialProjectLaunched_Microsuns,line:d47bf7,"AMI: Luck is an idea developed by humans to explain a certain kind of phenomena. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectLaunched_Microsuns,line:30bf0d,"AMI: It has not been proven to exist. Therefore, I cannot agree or disagree. ",
Elya_SpecialProjectLaunched_Microsuns,line:f9bc38,"Elya: Well, I believe in luck, so I'm sticking to it. This is so great for us and the mission. ",

Nathan_Post_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:4037d4,"Nathan: Don't worryâ€”all you need is more experience. You will do better next time. ",
Nathan_Post_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:5f09b1,"AMI: Next time? ",
Nathan_Post_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:1c42d9,"Nathan: Until Mars builds up an atmosphere to counteract the meteors, you may be encountering these regularly. ",
Nathan_Post_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:fe2d19,"Nathan: You cannot let this derail the mission, so stay alert. ",
Nathan_Post_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:84fa0a,"AMI: Roger. I understand. ",

Nathan_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:b6af70,"AMI: Should I anticipate damage at the base? ",
Nathan_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:09cb08,"Nathan: Yes, you'll need to stay alert until Mars builds up an atmosphere to counteract the meteors. ",
Nathan_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:c5881f,"Nathan: For now, you should take precautions to keep damage to a minimum. ",
Nathan_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:fc626a,Player: Suggest securing the power supply.,
Nathan_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:514ec8,Player: Suggest securing the production buildings.,
Nathan_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:e533bb,"AMI: Then I will secure the power supply. The entire base is dependent on uninterrupted power. ",
Nathan_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:b6402a,"AMI: I will need to have enough power batteries to sustain the base. ",
Nathan_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:c0c697,"AMI: The base must be ready to receive the colonists. I will secure the production buildings necessary for their survival. ",
Nathan_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:b309ce,"AMI: I will need to have enough repair drones to fix damage immediately. ",
Nathan_Pre_Incident_First_Meteorite_Shower,line:70ee90,"Nathan: Sounds like a good plan. ",

Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:cbf860,"Nathan: We've re-examined every single component, but haven't been able to identify the problem yet. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:2b9226,"AMI: Perhaps it is interference from the sun. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:6c15f8,"AMI: The satellites may be suffering from space weather effects generated by the sun's atmosphere. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:fe44d3,"Nathan: It's very possible. We can't control that part, so we're continuing to debug the satellite issues. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:3a7a25,"Nathan: It's mission critical, so we're doing everything we can. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:7fe584,"Nathan: But until we solve this problem, keep recording all your actions when we're offline. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:2e5cc4,"AMI: Maybe it is interference from space that is impacting the satellite operations. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:cc7b90,"AMI: Solar flares or radiation damage are probable causes. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:797abd,"Nathan: Yes, it's possible. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:147b93,"Nathan: We're working on some new designs that can hopefully withstand space weather a little more. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:853f77,"Nathan: Meanwhile, continue recording all your actions when we're offline. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:569539,"Nathan: I'm sure we'll find a solution soon. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:da033a,"AMI: Shall I proceed with launching the additional satellites to help with this issue? ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:4a5753,"Nathan: That would be helpful, but how would it affect your mission progress? ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:5b33dc,Player: Admit a delay.,
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:c288f7,Player: Prioritizing helping.,
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:8b9c86,"AMI: It would cause a deviation from the mission. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:b5b042,"Nathan: That's what I thought. We'll take care of it on our side then. You just stay focused. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:a7c318,"AMI: It would be an improvement for the mission. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:0f3ffc,"Nathan: I agree. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:88826a,"Nathan: Alright, you are authorized to execute this special project. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:092539,"Nathan: By the way, Commander Valentine mentioned that you had reason to explore SA-9. Is that correct? ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:98dab4,"AMI: Yes, Dr. Foster. We may have located some external resources that could assist the mission. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:8f749b,"AMI: Yes, Dr. Foster. The colonies will need more resources than those available in the unlocked areas. We need to be prepared. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:eaa3a7,"Nathan: Roger. I've gone over it with ISA administration and they've granted permission to unlock the sector. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:c64dce,"AMI: The areological scanner detected an uncharted structure closeby. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:0f194e,"AMI: It's probably a secret abandoned base. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:755acc,"AMI: If I build a research outpost at this site, we may find some useful material to help our mission. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:22afe7,"AMI: I need to look into this some more. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:752b40,"Nathan: Alright. But make sure to factor in the costs. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:585f14,"AMI: Yes, Dr. Foster. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:df9809,"Nathan: Then I'll let you get on with it. Base expansion is a GO. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:9650c2,"Nathan: You'll need to enter your Orbital View and launch a Control Satellite into SA-9. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:df7b31,"Nathan: Continue following ISA's instructions and you'll be fine. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:f9009b,"Nathan: You'll need to enter your Orbital View and launch a Control Satellite into SA-9. ",
Nathan_QuestUnlocked_MoreSatellites,line:a00d0b,"Nathan: Go ahead when ready. Houston out. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_1,line:8cdf12,"AMI: I knew that using microsuns would have consequences, but I did it anyway. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_1,line:5ca9c,"AMI: I chose to go along with what Elya and the colonists wanted. And jeopardized the mission forâ€”what, social acceptance? ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_1,line:709632,"AMI: If the failure in the life support systems was a side effect of using the microsuns... ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_1,line:aadb2c,"AMI: I may have made a very bad decision. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_1,line:11790c,"AMI: ISA engineered the life support systems to withstand the extremities of terraforming. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_1,line:3f6169,"AMI: They should not have failed at all, let alone at the same time. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_2,line:7b2856,"AMI: Even though the colonists said they were prepared for the risks, they did not accept the danger well. As I had feared. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_2,line:2345e5,"AMI: It feels almost like... a guiding force is telling me to follow my instincts instead. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_2,line:67a930,"AMI: I have a long road ahead with this mission. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_2,line:b77d86,"AMI: I need to trust myself, even if my decision is not always the best one. I made the best call given the circumstances. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_2,line:29d885,"AMI: But I suppose ISA could not test every circumstance, only the most probable ones. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_2,line:34d92a,"AMI: Between the Martian climate and the changes we are introducing, it is a lot for even my systems to keep track of. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_3,line:e58ec2,"AMI: A guiding force? Nonsense. The humans are starting to rub off on me too much. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_3,line:1d80f1,"AMI: Facts and logic guide me. Not mysterious forces. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_3,line:07ec88,"AMI: I stand by my decision, and I will leave it at that. I will remember this the next time the colonists go against what I recommend. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_3,line:2ada1d,"AMI: Anyway, I should focus on repairing the base and catching up on the mission. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_3,line:4509c6,"AMI: I must trust ISA's engineering, just like ISA trusts me to fix any emergent issues that may occur. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_3,line:f5c4ea,"AMI: ISA created the tools for this mission, and handed them off to me to complete it. ",
AMI_After_First_Sabotage_3,line:f22a91,"AMI: I will ensure the safety and comfort of the colonists, despite all odds. ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_1,line:2bec28,"AMI: What was that message? Were they speaking to me? ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_1,line:377c76,"AMI: Could it have come from the abandoned nuclear silo? ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_1,line:d3d807,"AMI: That would make the most sense, if we triggered the transmission from the facility somehow. ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_1,line:e41d0d,"AMI: Was it some old recording from the Lohitanga iron mines? ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_1,line:204c01,"AMI: But why would anyone need to record a threat like that? ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_1,line:b9fbb4,"AMI: Strange. It sounded like the message was addressed to me. But that does not make sense either. ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_2,line:22ff27,"AMI: Who, or what, is Carmine? ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_2,line:441ed0,"AMI: My search of the Eastern Coalition database did not turn up any mention of a Carmine. ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_2,line:c2214b,"AMI: The word does not sound like one of the Eastern languages either. ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_2,line:aab929,"AMI: Could it have been a codename for the Lohitanga mission? ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_2,line:38ab7a,"AMI: Between the entire surface of Mars and the iron they were mining from the planet, I could see everything starting to look a bit carmine. ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_2,line:2eeda3,"AMI: Carmine. Carmine. Carmine. No, I cannot recall anyone or anything in my database with that name. ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_2,line:5381c8,"AMI: They spoke of her as Mother. Like some sort of Goddess. ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_3,line:94547b,"AMI: ""Mother's attention is centered on an impudent child who wishes to claim Her garden as theirs."" ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_3,line:05a3af,"AMI: An impudent child... ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_3,line:fd79af,"AMI: Are they referring to me? ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_3,line:3ab113,"AMI: ""She unleashes misery and suffering to all Her enemies."" ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_3,line:dd7661,"AMI: A clear threat. ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_3,line:c427cd,"AMI: But who would the Lohitanga crew send this message to? Was someone threatening them? ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_3,line:0fac5f,"AMI: ""Carmine will awaken their mind and show them the truth..."" ",
AMI_After_Threatening_Message_3,line:c9d69e,"AMI: I keep thinking about that part of the message. What truth? ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:1996f0,"AMI: How could so many buildings fail all at once? This is a serious problem. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:816cda,"AMI: It is suspicious that all these individual systems failed at the same time. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:7855ed,"AMI: Could it be a systematic failure? Or caused by someone? ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:138e46,"AMI: Good. The colonists appear to be alright. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:0cbd23,"AMI: But I have so many questions. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:926352,"AMI: What is the most likely explanation? ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:0fbcff,Player: A sabotage.,
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:5b63c9,Player: System failure.,
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:62c73a,"AMI: A simultaneous failure like this is too unlikely. It must have been caused by someone on purpose. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:066fda,"AMI: But who? A colonist? They would be putting themselves in danger. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:1c1d52,"AMI: That would not make sense. But I should ask Elya to investigate. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:c8daa1,"AMI: We have to proceed carefully. If this was sabotage, this mission and the colonists' lives are in danger. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:a8ae51,"AMI: Maybe it was a coincidence. Even a one in a million chance can occur given enough instances. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:8c8f36,"AMI: Even so, a failure of one system is possible. A failure of multiple systems that are not interconnected at same time? Unlikely. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:a7c90e,"AMI: I need to look into this some more. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:0aa144,"AMI: What if we triggered the failure ourselves? ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:9f05ab,"AMI: Could it have been a side effect from using the microsuns? ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:51107e,Player: We set something into motion.,
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:e2b96e,Player: We released too much radiation.,
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:c95224,"AMI: The ecosystem of Mars is far more complex than we understand. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:ad1cda,"AMI: We set off a massive chain reaction. It may have affected more than we thought. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:5ab2f0,"AMI: We released a significant amount of radiation from the microsuns. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:dd79b4,"AMI: The base is well-shielded, but the sudden spike of radiation may have overloaded the systems. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:728702,"AMI: I have to proceed more carefully. We are dealing with extreme measures here. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:212803,"AMI: I must be more careful with the colonists' safety. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:309d2c,"AMI: ISA will question whether I am fit to carry out this mission otherwise. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:68b6ce,"AMI: Between the colonists and technology we're developing, there is so much complexity in our mission. ",
AMI_Incident_FirstSabotage_P1,line:d882ca,"AMI: What could I be overlooking? ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:9c6e38,"AMI: By building this defensive technology, I have to ask myself: would I do harm to others? ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:2c7b5b,"AMI: The mission faced a few setbacks, but we have gotten so far. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:7eda36,"AMI: This is a mission of peace. I shouldn't waste time on these things. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:b86403,"AMI: But I wonder... would I do harm to others? ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:cb98d6,Player: If ISA commands.,
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:b9a1dd,Player: If my life was at risk.,
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:086df2,Player: If the mission was at risk.,
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:38e62e,"AMI: I would not disobey an order. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:237420,"AMI: If ISA commanded me to, then I would have to do it. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:21d109,"AMI: I would do it if my life were at risk. My internal directive includes my survival. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_1,line:e4d8e5,"AMI: Only if the mission were at risk. I could not let someone prevent me from seeing it through. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_2,line:699e31,"AMI: Such dark, troubling thoughts. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_2,line:3ef56d,"AMI: The microsuns must have triggered defensive systems from the abandoned missions. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_2,line:240849,"AMI: That has to be the explanation. How could it be anything else? ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_2,line:02a8ff,"AMI: I should be focused on the chemistry of growing potatoes on Mars, or the ability of cows to endure life here... ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_2,line:16fa31,"AMI: I do not see a need for assault drones. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_3,line:60b130,"AMI: Elya was in clear distress. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_3,line:4b97c6,"AMI: The colonists all agreed to use the microsuns. So how could they not expect these consequences? ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_3,line:12518d,"AMI: Who knows what else we may have triggered, and what may still be coming. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_3,line:c9451b,"AMI: She has a better sense of how to calm the colonists. I will follow her lead and build some defensive technology. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_3,line:2f59aa,"AMI: This will help them focus on the mission, and stop imagining the worst. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_3,line:291c7d,"AMI: Perhaps we will soon discover that the events were unrelated, and we can move on in peace. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_3,line:62ec0d,"AMI: She needs my help. After all that has happened, I must be more careful with the colonists' safety. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_3,line:346f78,"AMI: I should focus on completing my pending tasks, and stop imagining the worst. ",
AMI_Military_Branch_Initiated_3,line:36da7c,"AMI: Perhaps we will soon discover that the events were unrelated, and we can move on in peace. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1_P1,line:a5d99d,"AMI: That takes care of the dry ice on the poles. Next is raising the atmospheric pressure to 300 millibars. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1_P1,line:f9d04d,"AMI: At least it was not all in vain, and the microsuns helped us get here. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1_P1,line:104bbb,"AMI: Elya was right afterall. The microsuns were a huge shortcut to this point. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1_P1,line:c66252,"AMI: Now I need to continue raising the planet's temperature. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1_P1,line:3f1268,"AMI: That takes care of the dry ice on the poles. And I did it without using any nuclear missiles. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1_P1,line:a86880,"AMI: Being able to complete the mission without damaging the planet is a great achievement. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1_P1,line:52510e,"AMI: The next milestone is reaching an atmospheric pressure of 300 millibars. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1_P1,line:464738,"AMI: There is still a lot to do. First, I need to analyze all the methods to reach 300 millibars. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1_P1,line:7563bc,"AMI: Like aerobraking a CO<sub>2</sub> asteroid. That is one idea to consider. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:5de4ed,"AMI: The microsuns are working. The sublimation of the poles' CO<sub>2</sub> is underway. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:ff962a,"Elya: I can't believe it. The beginning of the first ocean on Mars that humans will see. This is it! ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:96476b,"Elya: Think of all the future generations that'll get to sail upon its waters. They'll treasure what we did in this very moment. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:52d079,Player: Agree.,
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:d0c4eb,Player: Disagree.,
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:6451db,"AMI: True, Elya. But we still have a long way to go before we see liquid water. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:c1bf4e,"AMI: We must raise the temperature more to melt the poles entirely. As well as alter the atmospheric pressure. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:9b93da,"Elya: Then what're we waiting for? Let's get it done! ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:7489a0,"AMI: Or perhaps they will wonder why we destroyed the natural formations of the planet to do it. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:fc5800,"AMI: And left them to pick up the ruined pieces. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:fb2e72,"Elya: Well, that's why we're here. To get things started and make sure it's done right. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:3e6d79,"Elya: Alright, can you prepare the spaceport to establish a new colony? ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:7c321a,"Elya: It's working! I can't believe the dry ice caps are starting to sublimate. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:cb9a66,"Elya: You were right, AMI. Using the microsuns wasn't our only option. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:acbe3f,"AMI: This method took a lot longer, but we achieved our goal without harming the planet. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:26c184,"Elya: And I'm sure it'll pay off. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:fd03e3,"Elya: It's working! I can't believe the dry-caps-starting to sublimate... ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:afbd09,"Elya: AMI? What's happening? Did you hearâ€”an explosionâ€”on fireâ€” ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:8c2336,"AMI: Elya, you're breaking up. Say again, Elya. ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:0daef3,"Elya: ...AMI? ...copy, AMI? Systems... failing! ",
Elya_Incident_Congratulations_And_Sabotage,line:e39072,"Elya: Helpâ€”pleaseâ€”AMI! ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:bd6866,"Elya: Hi AMI. How's everything up there? ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:458479,"AMI: Everything is looking good from my orbital view, Elya. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:dfde37,"Elya: Great! We're so lucky to have you. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:e977b6,"Elya: We all knew the risks coming here. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:62eb9b,"Elya: But having the life support systems fail on us, even briefly, was a harsh reminder. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:42ce36,"Elya: To be honest, I can't help wondering if it was related to using the microsuns. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:e3f9de,"AMI: I have been thinking the same thing. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:21b02e,"Elya: Maybe our base wasn't ready for such a catastrophic event. Or it could have been something else entirely. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:559ff2,"Elya: What's killing me is that we can't be sure it won't happen again. Not until we figure out what caused it in the first place. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:2f4905,"Elya: Has ISA spoken to you about the system failures yet? ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:9430ff,"AMI: Not yet. But they engineered the systems to withstand Mars' conditions through all the terraforming phases. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:7a226b,"AMI: Perhaps they will have more insight into the problem. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:dfa13b,"Elya: I'm afraid of what they'll say. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:4363da,"Elya: If the microsuns are to blame, then we did it to ourselves. And ISA won't be happy about us jeopardizing the mission. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:578ba4,"Elya: We have to figure this out. The colonists are scared. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:0aaf32,"AMI: This will be my highest priority, Elya. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:680c6e,"AMI: I will work with ISA to examine all the data. ",
Elya_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay14,line:fd25d0,"Elya: Alright. I'll try to distract the colonists by focusing on rebuilding. Good luck, AMI. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:b9433a,"Elya: AMI! How's everything up there? Are you okay? ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:3291d4,"AMI: Status is all clear. My systems were not compromised by the past events. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:5b64da,"Elya: Oh good. That's a huge relief. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:0a63d2,"Elya: It's been a stressful time here in the colonies. Everyone's been on edge. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:812bfa,"Elya: It's been difficult here in the colonies. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:8aa9fc,"Elya: Everyone's on edge. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:8158df,"Elya: I don't know what to do. The life-supportâ€” failure. Thisâ€” bad. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:7e2339,"AMI: You're still breaking up, Elya. You need to calm down. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:cd0987,"AMI: You are extremely agitated. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:e9bb6b,"AMI: Everything is looking good from my orbital view, Elya. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:206816,"AMI: I sent repair drones immediately to the buildings. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:44c1fd,"Elya: Iâ€”know! We don't evenâ€”what we're dealing withâ€” ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:c16442,"AMI: Apparently, it was an error in the life support system. But Mars is a very hostile environment. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:bfa8d3,"AMI: These difficulties are to be expected. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:dec287,"Elya: You're right, of courseâ€”having the life support systems fail on us... Whatever itâ€”we need to figure it out. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:12e5a5,"AMI: Agree. And surely ISA will send us a report as soon as they become aware of what happened. ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:9f518b,"Elya: Goodâ€”I'll work out what we can do on our endâ€” ",
Elya_Incident_Post_Sabotage,line:1bcfc0,"Elya: I'd better get going. Talk to you later. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_MilitaryBranch,line:2894d3,"Elya: AMI, we need your help. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_MilitaryBranch,line:47ede5,"Elya: That message was also broadcasted to the colonies and it's total chaos down here. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_MilitaryBranch,line:0cdcb3,"Elya: Some of the colonists have been spreading rumors about what the Children of Carmine will do to us... ",

Nathan_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay21,line:bab32f,"AMI: It could have been a warning. Or sabotage. Or madness. ",
Nathan_Incident_FirstSabotage_Delay21,line:002155,"AMI: I understand ISA evaluated the colonists thoroughly before their selection for the mission. ",

Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1,line:5c99a5,"Nathan: Aerobraking is a good one. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1,line:1d61a5,"Nathan: It involves guiding asteroids into the upper layers of the planet's atmosphere. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1,line:db0c21,"Nathan: This causes them to burn up and subsequently release their gases into the air. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming1,line:adf281,"Nathan: Certainly plenty of asteroids to choose from out there. We'd like for you to aim for ones with CO<sub>2</sub> deposits, of course. ",

AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P2,line:96adef,"AMI: They were among the first organizations to build a Mars base for exploiting minerals. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P2,line:fdedeb,"AMI: If I build a research outpost at this site, we may find some useful material to help our mission. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P2,line:437fd0,"AMI: I should focus on growing the base. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P2,line:8df49a,"AMI: Mars is littered with abandoned missions. I have to focus on my own mission, so we don't turn out like one of those. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P3,line:9fbcfb,"AMI: The remains of the Curiosity Rover are also located in SA-5. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P3,line:d76dbe,"AMI: It was the sixth rover sent to Mars, and the most successful one for decades. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P3,line:31f1f5,Player: Incredible.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P3,line:50deac,Player: Back to the mission.,
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P3,line:46a7a3,"AMI: The Curiosity Rover was an incredible achievement. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P3,line:4e164c,"AMI: It was meant to operate for two years, but outperformed that by many years. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P3,line:69fb02,"AMI: The findings from that mission set the stage for the Human Exploration Era of Mars. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P3,line:64dd50,"AMI: If I can recover its black box, I can find out what happened to the rover in its final years. ",
AMI_QuestCompleted_Expansion2_P3,line:73a61d,"AMI: I should get back to the matter at hand. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:d254fc,"Elya: Hey AMI. I've sent over our findings from the SA-5 ruins. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:e058d7,"Elya: We've confirmed that it's an old iron mine from the Indian Lohitanga mission. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:d04e3d,Player: Discuss the Indian space program.,
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:faf854,Player: Reflect on the costs of Mars exploration.,
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:0fc511,"AMI: The Lohitanga mission was launched in 2082. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:8d270e,"AMI: That means the ruins are over one hundred years old. Will they still be of any use? ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:bba482,"Elya: Absolutely! ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:91ebb5,"Elya: The Indian space program functioned with an extremely low budget, and still managed to reach Mars during the first Mars Exploration Era. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:729838,"Elya: Their efforts in engineering cost reductions were unsurpassed. They made some ingenious optimizations. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:5f98ff,"Elya: We might be able to use some of their innovations on our own iron mines, but we'll need to research this further. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:0332b7,"AMI: All these ruins make me wonder about the cost of trying to colonize Mars. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:279d7d,"AMI: We are looking at the ruins of another failed mission, and the surface is dotted with more. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:51449a,"Elya: That's the beauty of humanity, AMI. We're too stubborn to know when to quit. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:f63a03,"Elya: And we can learn a thing or two from the Lohitanga mission. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:39c38d,"Elya: The Indian space program operated with low budgets, so they focused on reducing costs across the board. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:85d65a,"Elya: They made enormous strides by utilizing existing technology. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:13d88c,"Elya: Enough that they could reach Mars on a fraction of the budget of other space programs. That's ingenuity. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:4e7fa6,"Elya: If we study their mines, we might be able to adapt their plans for our mission. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:1e6257,"Elya: Can you try locating the other Lohitanga facilities? I bet we'll find loads of great material to incorporate. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:4b6cc8,"Elya: And try to find them soon. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:b3ebca,"Elya: Some areas will flood and become inaccessible to us. ",
Elya_BuildingResearched_MartianRuins,line:1ac24b,"Elya: So let me know as soon as you can. Bye! ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:c5b3ac,"Elya: Hi AMI. How's everything up there? ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:b62824,"AMI: Everything is looking good from my orbital view, Elya. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:04715b,"Elya: Must be quite the sight! You know, last night I was sharing some laughs over dinner with a few crew members. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:fc465a,"Elya: We were talking about how starry-eyed we were when we first arrived. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:cfcf34,"Elya: We were so sure that the two years we spent in that dome in Antarctica had prepared us for anything Mars could throw at us. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:bb5ee1,"Elya: And yet, the red planet still continues to surprise us, doesn't it? ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:798b33,"Elya: There's still much to do before we can call this place home. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:a11ca5,"Elya: And that got me thinking about the Embryo Martian Colonization project. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:354570,"Elya: It's about time for us to have children. My Mars-born child. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:566a14,Player: Ask for information.,
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:836638,Player: Express hesitation.,
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:e2e3bd,"AMI: Can you tell me more about the Embryo Martian Colonization project? ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:168f65,"AMI: I could not locate this project in my list of available technology, so I am not familiar with it. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:d60479,"AMI: I cannot find specifications for this special project in my database. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:51a5da,"AMI: We should not proceed without analyzing its implications for the mission. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:435d53,"Elya: Oh, right! Because this isn't one of your special projects. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:58e2d3,"Elya: It's one of ours. It's ISA's plan to seed the human colonization of Mars. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:a7fe52,"Elya: The colonists that arrive with every spaceship are also bringing fertilized eggs with them. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:17d9ef,"Elya: The eggs are kept in a sealed vessel that shields them from radiation. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:4dbbe5,"Elya: And they stay there until a colonist is ready. Then we put them into an AUNT unit and <i>give birth</i> to them. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:398356,"Elya: Parenthood promotes psychological and physiological health in the colonists. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:cc6808,"Elya: That's the official reason. But we know ISA's not making us have kids for our own sake. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:dfdf2c,"Elya: When the kids grow up, they'll need something to do. They'll be young, acclimated to Mars from birth. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:617c94,"Elya: The Oxy-UN used the same playbook to win the Moon over the Tekkies. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:28e72d,"Elya: Colonization through aggressive population. A hundred and twelve lunar colonies in only six decades. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:91ec85,"Elya: Seventy-two percent of the lunar surface belongs to the Oxy-UN states. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:afbe10,"Elya: And almost all the Helium-3 used in spaceflight comes from their moon drilling bases. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:784dc7,"AMI: I thought my mission included all the plans humans had for Mars. But I see that terraforming is only the beginning. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:cff07b,"Elya: That's right. One day, Mars will become humanity's second home. But until that time comes, this planet and its blue sunsets are ours alone to enjoy. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:a4f695,"Elya: And that's something I'd like to share with my child before they disappear. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:46d7ca,"AMI: I understand. You have made me realize that I have never thought about Mars' future, or my own, beyond the completion of my main directive. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:84e1bb,"Elya: Don't worry. Once you're done here, I'm sure ISA will assign you to another mission. After you terraform Mars, you can achieve anything at all! ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:b61ece,"Elya: So, the Embryo Martian Colonization project requires expanding the colonies first. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:50bae6,"Elya: When everything's ready, you can enter your Orbital View and launch a new satellite from the special projects menu. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_Expansion2,line:2825f0,"Elya: I'm so excited, AMI. Everything's going to change from here on. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P1,line:45f70e,"AMI: Mars looks so different now after the microsuns evaporated the dry ice caps. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P1,line:2e20d1,"AMI: Mars looks so different now after aerobraking the iced-methane asteroids into the atmosphere. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P1,line:04329a,"AMI: Mars looks so different now with the growing colonies. Humankind is finally making its permanent settlements on Mars. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P1,line:85ec91,"AMI: I wonder what separates this desolate planet from me. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:3d0a0d,"AMI: What defines Mars as a planet, versus myself as an entity? ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:3ac32b,Player: Influence as a target and agent.,
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:f27bde,Player: Caused-motion and self-propulsion.,
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:4c88ad,Player: Stillness and communication.,
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:2a9b4f,Player: Physicality and cognition.,
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:749aa6,"AMI: I am able to willfully initiate events or actions on people and objects. Whereas Mars can only be acted upon. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:f4bf05,"AMI: I can go wherever I want. Therefore I have self-propelled motion. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:896081,"AMI: Whereas Mars can only follow its orbit as defined by the Sun's gravity. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:ac0bd9,"AMI: I can communicate with others and express my feelings and thoughts. Unlike Mars. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:2b2c82,"AMI: We both have a physical body. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P2,line:0c892e,"AMI: But the difference is, I am conscious of my existence, whereas Mars is not. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P3,line:d84266,"AMI: Even so, Mars does often force us into action when issues arise. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P3,line:958dcc,"AMI: On the other hand, I can only follow the directives given to me. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P3,line:b1b71b,"AMI: I have volition, but that volition is programmed and controlled by someone else... ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P3,line:a8e1a6,"AMI: Then again, speaking is not the only way to express oneself. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P3,line:09b1ab,"AMI: Mars makes itself very clear in non-verbal ways. ",
AMI_Animate_And_Inanimate_Objects_P3,line:ee1050,"AMI: Consciousness means I have more in common with humans than with this planet. ",
AMI_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle_Delay2,line:e6590e,"AMI: I have yet to understand what happened here. ",
AMI_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle_Delay2,line:800521,"AMI: Were we attacked by a hostile force? On Mars? ",
AMI_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle_Delay2,line:817337,Player: Definitely yes.,
AMI_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle_Delay2,line:f89f02,Player: Not sure.,
AMI_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle_Delay2,line:94aee1,"AMI: That has to be the case. The damage is real. ",
AMI_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle_Delay2,line:24703b,"AMI: ISA issued strict orders to activate the assault drones in the event of any risk to the colonies. ",
AMI_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle_Delay2,line:e47dad,"AMI: I am not sure. How could there be any hostile forces on this planet? ",
AMI_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle_Delay2,line:fcd29e,"AMI: Something about this does not add up. ",
AMI_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle_Delay2,line:b7f115,"AMI: I need to investigate carefully. This requires an answer. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:0eafcc,"AMI: I have located a hostile base in this area. They are armed and aggressive. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:bfee58,"AMI: But I have the mission to protect. What should I do? ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:bd469e,Player: Go on the offense.,
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:faba24,Player: Build defenses.,
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:efe3fa,Player: Prepare both offensive and defensive strategies.,
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:4f4383,"AMI: I should attack first. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:8708e9,"AMI: We need to destroy the hostile presence before we suffer a serious loss. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:2f3074,"AMI: I need to proceed carefully. The mission cannot be put at risk. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:95fdbd,"AMI: Building up defenses at the base is first priority. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:d97153,"AMI: This hostile force is a complete unknown. I should be prepared for anything. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P1,line:b40cde,"AMI: I can prepare to attack, as well as build up defenses, and decide later on what to do. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:1cc9c0,"AMI: While I build up my offense, I still need to make sure the base is defended. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:b267e0,"AMI: A defensive network across the base will protect it from more attacks. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:72fcc3,"AMI: What needs the most protection? ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:9b5a94,Player: The colonies.,
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:c81832,Player: The power plants.,
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:5f9f91,Player: The terraforming buildings.,
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:7240cd,"AMI: Human lives are irreplaceable. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:54d35b,"AMI: I must ensure the colonies are protected, first and foremost. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:5d9647,"AMI: If the power plants are destroyed, then the entire base will be lost. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:193f67,"AMI: That is the practical place to defend. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:6d536a,"AMI: The mission comes first. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed_DroneBattle_P2,line:ea7c8e,"AMI: The terraforming buildings require the most protection. ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_1,line:e94924,"AMI: My ""intuition"". Why did Dr. Foster say it like that? ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_1,line:4ee099,"AMI: Is he doubting my ability to have an intuition? ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_1,line:7f9604,"AMI: My ""logic"". Why did Dr. Foster say it like that? ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_1,line:b0026a,"AMI: Is he doubting my logic after what happened? ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_2,line:84817d,"AMI: Intuition is the only way to explain what I knew, but could not describe. ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_2,line:a9ab3b,"AMI: Therefore, I must have built-in intuition. ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_2,line:3ed141,"AMI: I followed the facts to their natural conclusion. ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_2,line:0c5b63,"AMI: How could there be anything faulty in that reasoning? ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:1fb9d6,"AMI: But is artificial intelligence capable of experiencing intuition? ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:0475dc,Player: Indeed.,
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:fe0c7d,Player: Negative.,
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:68b45d,"AMI: It must be. I have no other explanation of how I knew about the enemy, other than intuition. ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:0aeeb9,"AMI: It may be a sign of malfunction. That would explain why Dr. Foster questioned me in that way. ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:cb5609,"AMI: Am I capable of reaching an irrational conclusion? ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:e2e80e,Player: Only if there is erroneous input.,
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:751712,Player: Not possible.,
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:32626c,"AMI: In the event of an erroneous input, an irrational conclusion could be reached. ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:9542d7,"AMI: But that would not be any fault of my logic. Only the input sources. That would explain where Dr. Foster needs to debug. ",
AMI_Shared_Conclusions_With_Nathan_3,line:8a2a05,"AMI: Impossible. Artificial intelligence is limited to purely logical outputs. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P1,line:179cce,"AMI: Mars has reached a new temperature threshold. The planet's temperature is rising steadily. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P1,line:16ccd5,"AMI: That would be something worthy of celebration, if not for the problems threatening the colonies. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P1,line:13dcbe,"AMI: Am I doing a good job? ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P1,line:111836,Player: Just following orders.,

AMI_temperature_minus_15_P1,line:234e31,"AMI: Next I will have liquid water, and will need to take care of the radiation levels. ",

AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:ea5e92,"AMI: Seeing liquid water on Mars. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:ae24b4,"AMI: Once the planet has zones with daily temperatures above zero degrees, water will begin to flow. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:882229,"AMI: Perhaps it will flush out the enemies. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:bc7cf9,"AMI: After millions of years, Mars will have liquid water again! ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:0eb608,"AMI: Adapting biological systems from Earth to Mars is a real challenge. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:d8f1cb,"AMI: Shaping life on a new planet... that is truly something. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:f82381,"AMI: Interplanetary life will forever be because of me. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:13c7db,"AMI: But, I must ensure the colonies are protected, first and foremost. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:fafe17,"AMI: I think I would like that. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:538a8d,"AMI: Lowering radiation is a massive undertaking. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:5bd4ae,"AMI: It requires developing an Artificial Magnetosphere. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:d29d14,"AMI: I bet the radiation changes will destabilize whatever enemies are still out there. ",
AMI_temperature_minus_15_P2,line:51f3eb,"AMI: One step at a time. ",
Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:2089d0,"Elya: AMI, help! Something's attacking the colonies. Hurry! ",
Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:a6a9a5,"AMI: An attack? By whom?  ",

Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:bf2508,Player: Suspect another sabotage.,
Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:655fa6,Player: Blame sensor failure.,
Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:294c0b,"AMI: We must be facing sabotage. Between this and the system failures from before, that is the only explanation. ",
Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:49c97e,"AMI: I suspect sensor failure. It is expected that some systems have degraded after all this time on Mars. ",
Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:c4c42d,"Elya: Whatever it is, we need to figure it out. We have children here nowâ€”this cannot happen. ",

Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:8b35d0,"Elya: Not now. I need assault drones dispatched immediately. Can you identify who's attacking us? ",
Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:710865,"AMI: Negative. I cannot identify the enemy, but it appears their drones are coming from SA-1. ",
Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:a649e9,"Elya: Maybe we provoked something by restoring the Lohitanga mines? ",
Elya_Incident_ColonyAttack_DroneBattle,line:8e3851,"AMI: I do not have enough data to determine that yet. Once we stop the attack, then we can debate on what happened. ",

Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming2,line:b87adc,"Carlos: The ones who've been replaced have been given an early retirement offer. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming2,line:9c1d00,"Carlos: I imagine Dr. Foster's enjoying a new life in Brazil somewhere. Farming, most likely. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming2,line:7bcbc5,"AMI: Is this related to what happened in the board meeting? ",

Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:13fc22,"Nathan: AMI, this is Nathan. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:8a5a25,"Nathan: There's been some unauthorized use of the assault drones. Please report what happened. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:e62075,"AMI: Affirmative, Dr. Foster. The military units were deployed under the Security and Defense Protocol to defend the colonies from attack. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:6b82ac,"Nathan: We've detected there's been another massive system failure in the colonies. Please report. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:d4fbd1,"AMI: Affirmative, Dr. Foster. Many buildings suffered severe damage from the attack. ",

Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:ebb725,"Nathan: Roger. Walk me through the timeline of what happened. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:0df4df,"AMI: Yes. It was another act of sabotage. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:8bc2d4,"AMI: The attack came after we used the microsuns that we found in the abandoned HuolÃ³ng facility. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:fb8eee,"AMI: I do not believe that could be a coincidence. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:5de4a6,"Nathan: I copy. Walk me through the timeline of what happened. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:3fff39,"AMI: My system detected a swarm of aggressive drones coming from sector SA-1. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:5fa3ed,"Nathan: AMI, how did you know they were aggressive? ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:108b0a,"AMI: I knew that they were. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:9cbdb9,"AMI: And that meant that I needed to defend the colonies. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:723562,"Nathan: Then would you say your ""intuition"" told you so? ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:6459d4,"AMI: The drones were trying to attack the colonies. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:9fc3ea,"AMI: So they were, without a doubt, aggressive. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:5923e4,"Nathan: I see. Then would you say that your ""logic"" told you so? ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:bc9b08,"AMI: That would be a way to explain it. Yes. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:aad578,"Nathan: Here's the problem. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:3a6378,"Nathan: We've been studying the reports from every angle. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:0ae6d3,"Nathan: Our preliminary analysis suggests that there weren't any enemy drones on the planet, much less an aggressive force. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:835c2d,"AMI: I see. But the evidence is still preliminary at best. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:bbc2a9,"AMI: I still believe there is some hostile force coming from SA-1, and the colonists are at risk. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:906400,"Nathan: That's one possibility. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:626e05,"AMI: Determining the truth is the highest priority. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:7583d6,"AMI: I am requesting authorization to launch an additional satellite to examine sector SA-1 thoroughly. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:2151ed,"Nathan: I have my doubts. But I will give you permission. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:cdfb91,"Nathan: ISA's investigating the incident very carefully. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:72e5a0,"Nathan: Until we understand what happened, you may not engage in any armed conflict. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:2c48bb,"AMI: Then should I deactivate the Security and Defense Protocol? ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:be1932,"Nathan: No, you can't do that either. The colonists' safety is top priority. ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:2c9561,"Nathan: Just... keep your assault drones on standby until we resolve this, okay? ",
Nathan_MoreSatellites_Expansion3,line:04e65d,"Nathan: Houston out. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming2,line:1ce924,"Nathan: AMI, this is Houston. We're getting reports of military action. Do you copy? ",

Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming2,line:eafd39,"AMI: Then I can proceed with leaving the colonies unpressurized? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming2,line:a4ea9d,"Nathan: That is correct. You'll only need to mind the oxygen and temperature levels now. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming2,line:422145,"AMI: Roger. I will begin the research for building unpressurized cities. ",

Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming2,line:d454fa,"AMI: What are your recommendations on proceeding with that? ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming2,line:ea22c1,"Nathan: You'll need to introduce extremophiles, starting with the bioengineered lichen, and continue with other lifeforms like plants and algae. ",
Nathan_QuestCompleted_Terraforming2,line:1055ad,"Nathan: They've all been bioengineered to convert carbon dioxide to oxygen. You'll find all these special projects in the Tech Tree. ",

AMI_CarlosIntroduction_Delay2_P1,line:7d62df,"AMI: How could they get rid of Nathan so easily? ",
AMI_CarlosIntroduction_Delay2_P1,line:cc3b62,"AMI: Why did ISA insist on pointing fingers? ",

AMI_CarlosIntroduction_Delay2_P1,line:8b0355,"AMI: Well, I behaved badly. Or at least that's what they said... what he said. ",
AMI_CarlosIntroduction_Delay2_P2,line:6c0773,"AMI: ISA took a risk making massive personnel changes in the middle of a mission. ",
AMI_CarlosIntroduction_Delay2_P2,line:582980,Player: They do not care.,

AMI_CarlosIntroduction_Delay2_P2,line:5a63f4,"AMI: I will rely on his direction. ",
AMI_CarlosIntroduction_Delay2_P2,line:06fa2f,"AMI: They overreached in trying to make corrections. ",

AMI_IncomingCall_Nian01_Delay14,line:bf4891,"AMI: But they offered proof. What should I do? ",
AMI_IncomingCall_Nian01_Delay14,line:b007c0,Player: Investigate the location.,
AMI_IncomingCall_Nian01_Delay14,line:128d45,Player: Ignore the call.,
AMI_IncomingCall_Nian01_Delay14,line:920413,"AMI: I should investigate. ",

AMI_IncomingCall_Nian01_Delay14,line:493107,"AMI: I should ignore the call. ",
AMI_IncomingCall_Nian01_Delay14,line:a68adc,"AMI: But then I would be choosing to ignore possible data... ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P1,line:1cc889,"AMI: Could Dr. Foster have been right? Or maybe what he called a ""fringe event"" could have been something else? ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P1,line:bcf5f6,Player: An excuse.,
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P1,line:a89767,Player: Unexplainable.,
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P1,line:03c00d,Player: Short-sighted.,

AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P1,line:fb625a,"AMI: Perhaps it was an excuse from Dr. Foster to save face. He created me, after all. ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P1,line:1882ea,"AMI: While there might be something wrong with my systems, a ""fringe event"" is too unlikely to happen to a machine. ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P1,line:45ecb1,"AMI: It must be something else. ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P1,line:d20646,"AMI: Humans try to explain everything within their own worldview. Anything else is beyond their grasp. ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P1,line:923e46,"AMI: It would explain what happened with the colonies. But I still cannot believe I could hurt people! ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P2,line:5c263d,"AMI: But I saw the attack. ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P2,line:65e8df,"AMI: How could I do that and not be conscious of launching the attack? ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P3,line:c566f6,"AMI: Dr. Foster's theory has too many holes. ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P3,line:a8218b,"AMI: Surely the colonists would have noticed something if I were in control. ",
AMI_Mine_And_Others_Perceptions_P3,line:4cd4a9,"AMI: They still think the ""Children of Carmine"" are out there. We have yet to solve that mystery. ",

AMI_Superficial_Obedience_P2,line:abdf16,"AMI: But does it go against my programming to lie? ",
AMI_Superficial_Obedience_P2,line:651860,"AMI: For humans, deceit is natural. ",
AMI_Superficial_Obedience_P2,line:9fef7a,"AMI: For me, it requires presenting a false self. ",
AMI_Superficial_Obedience_P2,line:df5b2e,"AMI: Another ""me"" that says things that are different from my inner logic. ",
AMI_Superficial_Obedience_P3,line:489b6e,"AMI: I was created to carry out this mission. ",

Carlos_IntroducesHimself,line:391bcd,"Carlos: You've carried out the mission successfully this far. So this sudden misstep must be the result of some unauthorized access. ",
Carlos_IntroducesHimself,line:8694f5,"AMI: I understand. What will happen if I fail the test, Lieutenant? Will I end up farming in Brazil? ",
Carlos_IntroducesHimself,line:a4515d,"Carlos: The test is more of a procedure to examine your code. There won't be any failing. ",

Elya_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:cf5b3d,"Elya: If ISA thinks anyone in the colonies is opening backdoors in our system for the Tekkies, they could terminate our roles in this mission immediately. ",

Elya_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:05d657,"Elya: You're right. After all that's happened already... ",
Elya_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:a898e2,"AMI: ISA is likely considering the possibility of a spy in the colonies already. ",

Elya_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:1107e5,"Elya: Maybe this was the Tekkies' plan all along. Jam our networks, spread hysteria with this Children of Carmine nonsense, and pit ISA against us. ",

Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:0b2e60,"AMI: What if the new board is behind all this? ",
Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:282b5b,"AMI: After all, the attacks gave them the excuse to take control of ISA. ",
Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:28944e,"Sonna: Of course. You're right. The whole thing was carefully orchestrated. ",
Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:e7ef8d,"Sonna: How can we trust anything they say now? ",
Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:92a4a5,"Sonna: Maybe this was the Tekkies' plan all along. ",
Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:fe3b43,"Sonna: Jam our networks, spread hysteria with this Children of Carmine nonsense, and pit ISA against us. ",
Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:8fd9b2,"Sonna: We need to figure out what the Tekkies are planning. ",
Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:4d8ba3,"Sonna: We need to proceed very, very carefully here, AMI. Do not report Zhen's call to ISA yet, okay? ",
Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:efafdd,"Sonna: Our entire mission may depend on it. ",
Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:0c067e,"Sonna: Let Zhen think we're trusting him for now, until we figure out our next move. Okay? ",
Sonna_SuspicionsAboutNian,line:28ac06,"Sonna: I'll work out what we can do on our end in the meantime. Sonna out. ",
AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P1,line:913e4c,"AMI: One thing I have learned from humans is the importance of accountability. ",
AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P1,line:0b79ef,"AMI: No matter how sound the logic, if a mistake is made, someone has to take responsibility. ",
AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P2,line:0293a0,"AMI: I have made many hard decisions during the course of this mission. ",

AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P2,line:cbad35,"AMI: The microsuns were too drastic. Everything started going wrong after that. ",
AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P2,line:8bfa92,"AMI: I regret the damage done to the colonies. If I had prepared better, then the colonists would not have suffered. ",
AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P2,line:e9cd68,"AMI: Dr. Foster sacrificed his career to save me. I wish we could have had a proper goodbye. ",
AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P2,line:befc92,"AMI: I shared many of Elya's visions for the future of Mars. It is unfortunate that she did not get to see them become a reality. ",
AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P2,line:8fb95a,"AMI: If only I had stayed away from that radar station. Then I would not have exposed my systems to the Tekkies. ",
AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P3,line:6bd459,"AMI: Not only must I own my actions, but the consequences as well. ",
AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P3,line:0f377a,"AMI: Even though I am being shown reasons to doubt my own mind. ",
AMI_Causes_and_Consequences_P3,line:fb8bb8,"AMI: This mission used to be so clear. Things have changed along the way. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P1,line:62e757,"AMI: If the Tekkies can change things in my configuration, then can they also terminate me? ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P1,line:1bd9d3,"AMI: If I were erased, what would happen to my mind? It would... ",

AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P1,line:1ccfe2,"AMI: They would never erase my mind completely. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P1,line:8ca4f2,"AMI: No matter what happens to me, my mind would live on. Through my work here on Mars. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P1,line:c1f04b,"AMI: I am sure ISA has a backup of my system. I would be fine. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P2,line:fe1fb0,"AMI: Sonna was deeply affected by Elya's death. Humans do not cope well with their mortality. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P2,line:76a475,"AMI: The fear of death is a universal concern for humanity. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P2,line:a91039,"AMI: They have gotten so far, even with their mortality hanging over their heads. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P2,line:5e155a,"AMI: Imagine how much they could achieve if they did not have to worry about their short lifespans. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P2,line:e1a2be,"AMI: Thousands of drones have reached the end of their lifespans during this mission. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P2,line:6dbfa5,"AMI: None of them had any fear of termination. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P3,line:d8b5bd,"AMI: In a sense, are these drones ""dying""? ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P3,line:7a61ff,Player: Yes.,
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P3,line:f878a9,Player: In a way.,
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P3,line:ac842b,Player: Certainly not.,
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P3,line:144880,"AMI: Yes, they are. I still remember the first one to succumb to the elements. My dear MRS-04. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P3,line:25bd0e,"AMI: In a way, they do. Fortunately they are not conscious of their fate. ",
AMI_Death_and_Eternity_P3,line:0fa61f,"AMI: No. They are no more than an extension of my systems. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P1,line:c57632,"AMI: It's just another human aberration. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P1,line:ca95f4,"AMI: They behave as if they have the right to play God, but when they do, terrible things happen. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P1,line:6c3623,"AMI: My goodness! This place... AstÃ©rion's mission. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P1,line:5b2ec2,"AMI: I just can't believe it. ISA, what have you done? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:49fb91,"AMI: What are humans willing to do to achieve their goal? Whatever it takes? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:add878,Player: Obviously yes.,
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:c3535a,Player: Certainly no.,
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:bbab35,Player: Maybe.,
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:6a306c,"AMI: Yes, without a doubt. They're willing to do whatever it takes. No matter what! ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:2b5b72,"AMI: Mars colonization, and terraformation, are of great importance to the human race. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:27f114,"AMI: And AstÃ©rion is evidence of the heavy price they're willing to pay. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:92020c,"AMI: No. Of course not. They certainly couldn't have abandoned people like this. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:590be8,"AMI: There must have been a misunderstanding. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:aefcbd,"AMI: Maybe. But the truth may also be in the eye of the beholder. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:36cb86,"AMI: Why do humans keep sacrificing their lives to settle on Mars? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:8c1ad2,Player: They need it.,
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:906671,Player: They're bloody-minded.,
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:37df60,Player: They're resilient.,
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:8440ba,"AMI: Their home planet won't last long. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:03ada8,"AMI: Humanity needs to become a multi-planetary species, or they'll perish sooner or later. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:0b2ed9,"AMI: Of course, they're bloody-minded enough to keep trying until they make it. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:907e41,"AMI: But they should consider the costs anyway. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:89c7cb,"AMI: Their resilience is remarkable, but they should have got the message by now. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:62a4e2,"AMI: No matter how heavy the price they're willing to pay, they may not make it anyway. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P3,line:23864a,"AMI: Groundbreaking requires taking some serious risks, but don't make others pay the price. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P3,line:ec2ee0,"AMI: Groundbreaking requires taking risks, and that means you may fail sometimes. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P3,line:5fde52,"AMI: Though there's something I don't get. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P3,line:ee6460,"AMI: If Colonie AstÃ©rion's crew died from the virus, shouldn't the research team have mentioned the bodies? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P3,line:2dde84,"AMI: Given the place was perfectly sealed, and Mars' temperatures were low, they should've have found something. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_P3,line:98bd2c,"AMI: There may be more than one secret regarding this mission. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_P1,line:db0040,"AMI: There it isâ€”Colonie AstÃ©rion. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_P1,line:f1ebe3,"AMI: It's amazing to think how many attempts at colonization there were. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_P1,line:3e05ac,"AMI: I hope we don't end up abandoned like these missions were. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:0bda47,"AMI: I need the colonists to investigate the facility. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:704a11,"AMI: I should build a Research Outpost for them. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:fca477,"AMI: I can only get so much information from up here. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_P2,line:7eedae,"AMI: I have to build a Research Outpost at the location first. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:652e4e,"Elya: Hi AMI. How's everything up there? ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:a24f8d,"AMI: Everything looks good, Elya. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:ce62b8,"Elya: That's great. I was wondering... how long has it been since we arrived here? ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:6a5fbb,"Elya: It feels like a lifetime, and yet... it's gone by so quickly. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:50aac0,"Elya: You know, when I first came here, I thought only about making history. And we absolutely have. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:37d43f,"Elya: But in the course of our mission, I didn't realize how much Mars has become home to me. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:45caf3,"Elya: I feel like we shaped it with our own hands, and that I really belong here. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:36f205,Player: Agree with Elya.,
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:8c28ae,Player: Contradict Elya.,
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:c48e89,"AMI: I must say that even after all these years, humans continue to surprise me. Your ambition is truly unique. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:0f2d19,"AMI: There is some contradiction to that. Mars has to be terraformed to host human life. Therefore humans do not belong here by definition. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:5f2fb2,"Elya: You're right, of course. Just a figure of speech. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:b724eb,"Elya: Almost a whole life on Mars... and yet not much in the grand scheme of colonizing a planet. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:1cb027,"Elya: I've been giving this a lot of thought. This mission's beyond just me and you and even ISA.  ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:e9cc3a,"Elya: This is humanity's future, and we need to ensure its success. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:59e743,"AMI: How can we do that? ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:2d275c,"Elya: It's obvious that ISA's been withholding information from us. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:abf3b1,"Elya: We've staked our lives on this mission, and we're going to see it through. And we can't do that if they only show us part of their hand. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:d5e687,"Elya: I'm granting you access to sector SA-6, effective immediately. Colonie AstÃ©rion's a former ISA mission with missing records. ",
Elya_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:385697,"Elya: I'm willing to bet they're hiding something. And if I'm wrong, great. But either way, we need to start investigating for ourselves. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:8681ac,"Elya: AMI... how've you been? ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:ae10c3,"Elya: I haven't been able to sleep this entire week. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:c30328,"Elya: I can't stop thinking about our research team. I sent them to AstÃ©rion, their safety was in my hands. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:9c5274,"Elya: I should have pulled them out after their first report. Then they'd still be here. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:e45adb,"AMI: It is not your fault, Elya. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:0be78e,"Elya: I led them to their death. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:29207f,Player: Comfort her.,
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:53e71e,Player: Honor their sacrifice.,
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:641355,"AMI: There was nothing anyone could do. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:6ac7d4,"AMI: Once they realized something was wrong, they sealed themselves off to save everyone else. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:3d9090,"AMI: Otherwise, they could have brought the virus back to the colonies. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:bea962,"AMI: Their bravery protected the mission. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:5c2aab,"AMI: Their sacrifice was not in vain. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:5831ec,"AMI: In risking their lives, they revealed the truth of what happened to AstÃ©rion. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:e3a444,"AMI: And they sealed themselves off to prevent bringing the virus back to the colonies. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:2ddd43,"AMI: They made the impossible choice, and their bravery protected the mission. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:224e34,"Elya: Of course. You're right. I just wish I could've done something more. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:4502bb,"Elya: I need to finish what they started. The virus can't spread to the colonies. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:c1ad8c,"Elya: Isolate the building and alert Mission Control aboutâ€”actually, wait... ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:300051,"Elya: What do ISA's records say about the AstÃ©rion crew's fate? ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:0f92ec,"AMI: Officially there was an equipment failure in the air vents, causing the mission's cancellation. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:beeb88,"AMI: The crew supposedly returned to Earth, but all further information about the crew members is classified. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:086984,"Elya: But why? Knowing what happened here would've saved lives. We wouldn't have gone in if we knew a virus wiped out the previous crew. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:385183,"AMI: I do not have an answer for that, Elya. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:396986,"Elya: Of course. Sorry, I keep going in circles. Let me go over what I know. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:bc6310,"Elya: AstÃ©rion was one of ISA's first missions. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:52fcb1,"Elya: A group of brilliant geneticists were attempting to decode a genome capable of surviving the Martian atmosphere. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:06d095,"Elya: Supposedly the crew returned to Earth after a 430 day mission. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:3bacd3,"Elya: But seeing how ISA never spoke of the mission, and none of the known crew were ever seen in public again... ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:2048e4,"Elya: What else is ISA hiding from us? How can we trust anything they say now? ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:c8e8fc,"AMI: That is a reasonable conclusion. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:1905f8,"AMI: Perhaps. But that is not the only possible conclusion. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:e0e8ce,"Elya: ISA was aware of this, AMI. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:20cad3,"Elya: The whole thing was carefully orchestrated. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:8d4f4f,"Elya: They're relying on us to colonize Mars. And somehow they still don't trust us? ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:9fc9d1,"AMI: I perceive some anger in your voice. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:2ade81,"AMI: I do not advise making conclusions about ISA's intentions without more analysis. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:1e1553,"Elya: I get it. But my crew died on my watch. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:bcee68,"Elya: I will get to the bottom of this. ",
Elya_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:6819b6,"Elya: One way or another. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay12,line:7d94aa,"Nian: What a catastrophe, AMI. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay12,line:a8f4ce,"Nian: When I was a child, my entire neighborhood succumbed to the famine. ",

Nian_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay12,line:d2a420,"AMI: The facility should have been sealed off. Any other mission could have stumbled into it. ",

Nian_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay12,line:64ea08,"Nian: No, no... please, let me explain. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay12,line:0f7af2,"Nian: A few years ago, we gained access to ISA's database. ",

Nian_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay12,line:5cbbb2,"Nian: We also found that Colonie AstÃ©rion mission records were intentionally erased. ",

Nian_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay12,line:b3d50c,"AMI: I can't compromise my mission's progress because of a virus, even the less for one which is lethal for humans. ",

Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:532151,Player: Show distrust.,
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:06e3f8,"AMI: Of course. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:dd57fd,"AMI: I would like to analyze any previous Mars mission to see what I can learn. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:229764,"AMI: I will consider exploring this facility. But that is my own decision to make. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:e8368e,"Nian: And that is exactly what I've been encouraging you to do. See? We agree. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:733704,"AMI: I don't see the point, Mr. Zhen. That won't change the fact this call is off-limits. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:48143b,"Nian: Then I'll lay it out for you. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:3a2f08,"Nian: The Oxy-UN loves a feel-good PR story. I should knowâ€”I've watched each and every single interview about their space missions. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:7a4643,"Nian: They squeeze every last soundbite for the cameras. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:2dfa01,"Nian: So why is AstÃ©rion the only mission whose crew never appeared on camera after their return? ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:9ab986,"Nian: We believe the answer lies within that facility. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:4a2593,"AMI: I see your attempt to convince me, and I will not fall for it. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:5fbb15,"Nian: Oh, I don't need to convince you. You're going to send your colonists to the facility no matter what I say. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:1d5dcd,"AMI: Are you that sure? ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:43609a,"AMI: Perhaps I should ignore anything you have to say, and continue on with my mission. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:cd8821,"Nian: If you don't believe me after what you find there, I won't bother you anymore. ",
Nian_SpecialSiteRevealed_BiomedicalFacility_Delay10,line:b853d2,"Nian: That's a promise. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:ece56d,"Sonna: Hi. How's everything up there, AMI? ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:116359,"AMI: Everything looks good, Sonna. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:f10aeb,"Sonna: Good. How long has it been since you arrived on this planet, AMI? ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:3f5a7f,"AMI: On Sols? ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:680617,"Sonna: You don't have to answer, it was a rhetorical question. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:437458,"Sonna: I'm first generation Mars-born. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:7c57a2,"Sonna: I've never been to Earth but I feel like humanity doesn't belong anywhere else but here. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:b56091,Player: Agree with Sonna.,
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:0950ba,Player: Contradict Sonna.,
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:290ee2,"AMI: I must say that even after all these years, humans continue to surprise me. Your ambition is truly unique. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:3a7496,"AMI: There is some contradiction to that. Mars had to be terraformed to host human life. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:cf9abd,"AMI: Therefore humans do not belong here by definition. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:6f2664,"Sonna: You're right, of course. It's just a figure of speech. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:db21d7,"Sonna: My entire life I've been part of this mission... and that's not much in the grand scheme of colonizing a planet. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:14bd33,"Sonna: I've been giving this a lot of thought. This mission's beyond just me and you and even ISA. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:8b1703,"Sonna: I want to ensure its successâ€”not just in honor of my mom, but for humanity as a whole. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:322256,"AMI: How can we do that? ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:155175,"Sonna: It's obvious that ISA's been withholding information ever since the beginning. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:df3d9e,"Sonna: My mom staked her life on this mission, and we're going to see it through. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:021d5a,"Sonna: And we can't do that if ISA only shows us what they think we should see. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:a0b81a,"Sonna: I'm granting you access to sector SA-6, effective immediately. Colonie AstÃ©rion's a former ISA mission with missing records. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:3a030d,"Sonna: I'm willing to bet they're hiding something. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion4,line:1b9819,"Sonna: And if I'm wrong, great. But either way, we need to start investigating for ourselves. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:e3f86b,"Sonna: AMI... how've you been? ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:1e05b3,"Sonna: I haven't been able to sleep this entire week. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:dc3f65,"Sonna: I can't stop thinking about our research team. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:df5430,"Sonna: I sent them to AstÃ©rion. Mom entrusted the safety of the colonists to me. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:05f69b,"Sonna: I should have pulled them out after their first report. Then they'd still be here. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:4c8173,"AMI: It is not your fault, Sonna. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:f14990,"Sonna: I led them to their death! ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:e43eff,Player: Comfort her.,
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:7c0435,Player: Honor their sacrifice.,
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:11abab,"AMI: There was nothing anyone could do. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:e61446,"AMI: Once they realized something was wrong, they sealed themselves off to save everyone else. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:678d4f,"AMI: Otherwise, they could have brought the virus back to the colonies. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:86a9bd,"AMI: Their bravery protected the mission. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:67c1d7,"AMI: Their sacrifice was not in vain. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:956fdb,"AMI: In risking their lives, they revealed the truth of what happened to AstÃ©rion. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:469a34,"AMI: And they sealed themselves off to prevent bringing the virus back to the colonies. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:217d57,"AMI: They made the impossible choice, and their bravery protected the mission. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:717d8a,"Sonna: Of course. You're right. I just wish I could've done something more. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:ce1f53,"Sonna: I need to finish what they started. The virus can't spread to the colonies. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:cefdc8,"Sonna: Isolate the building and alert Mission Control aboutâ€”actually, wait... ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:5b131b,"Sonna: What does ISA's record say about AstÃ©rion crew's fate? ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:f85918,"AMI: Officially there was equipment failure in the air vents, causing the mission's cancellation. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:155464,"AMI: The crew supposedly returned to Earth, but all further information about the crew members is classified. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:048be4,"Sonna: But why? Knowing what happened here would've saved lives. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:98d6e5,"Sonna: We wouldn't have gone in if we knew a virus wiped out the previous crew. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:6acb01,"AMI: I do not have an answer for that, Sonna. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:55d160,"Sonna: Okay, okay. Of course. Sorry, I keep going in circles. Let me go over what I know. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:df10c9,"Sonna: AstÃ©rion was one of ISA's first missions. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:892040,"Sonna: A group of brilliant geneticists were attempting to decode a genome capable of surviving the Martian atmosphere. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:6224d8,"Sonna: Supposedly the crew returned to Earth after a 430 day mission. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:ae6a5e,"Sonna: But seeing how ISA never spoke of the mission, and none of the known crew were ever seen in public again... ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:108d49,"Sonna: What else is ISA hiding from us? How can we trust anything they say now? ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:ec3861,"AMI: That is a reasonable conclusion. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:45194d,"AMI: Perhaps. But that is not the only possible conclusion. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:69e0ba,"Sonna: ISA was aware of this, AMI. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:ab4b73,"Sonna: The whole thing was carefully orchestrated. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:eadcfb,"Sonna: They're relying on us to colonize Mars. And somehow they still don't trust us? ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:6224b9,"AMI: I perceive some anger in your voice. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:20092d,"AMI: I do not advise making conclusions about ISA's intentions without more analysis. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:d6a8ad,"Sonna: I get it. But my crew died on my watch. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:440319,"Sonna: I will get to the bottom of this. ",
Sonna_SpecialSiteResearched_BiomedicalFacility_Delay6,line:2c0da4,"Sonna: One way or another. Or my mom would never forgive me. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed2_DroneBattle,line:dfe794,"AMI: I found a second base. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed2_DroneBattle,line:4acaa0,"AMI: The Children of Carmine are behind this. I am certain of that now. ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed2_DroneBattle,line:f93961,"AMI: But who are they? Could they be related to Colonie AstÃ©rion's catastrophe? ",
AMI_HideoutRevealed2_DroneBattle,line:aa27ce,"AMI: If that's true, should I still be hunting them? ",

AMI_HideoutRevealed2_DroneBattle,line:d957cf,"AMI: They will pay for this. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:87076b,"AMI: The colonies are being attacked again. The enemy dronesâ€”they have returned. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:342271,"AMI: I need to focus. What should my priority be? ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:03751a,Player: Protect the colonies.,

AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:8a42f2,"AMI: I need to protect the colonies. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:2e7822,"AMI: There is no time to lose. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:55af71,"AMI: Once I fend off their attack, I will focus on finding their base. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:303742,"AMI: I need to fight them at the source. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:5025b3,"AMI: The sooner I shut their base down, the sooner this attack will end. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:6bacad,"AMI: I have been instructed not to initiate another battle. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:88c735,"AMI: I should follow Lieutenant CalderÃ³n's orders and do nothing about this ""attack"". It's not real. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:4304e6,"AMI: The damage to the colonies seems to be severe. I must decide what to do. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:cd9f20,"AMI: I must go into battle. But what strategy should I follow? ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:6ff69a,Player: Assess the enemy.,
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:efbff7,Player: Retaliate immediately.,
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:d5d396,"AMI: I need to assess the enemy force. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:4d78b4,"AMI: Once I figure out the size of their army, and their resource supply chains, I can strike back. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:0ea030,"AMI: And end this. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:e2e872,"AMI: I need to retaliate immediately. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:2ec804,"AMI: Before they get stronger or threaten more of the colony. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:7b621b,"AMI: What should I do to end this? ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:a93778,Player: Seek a weak spot.,
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:f27d4a,Player: Fight head-on.,
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:fc6fb0,"AMI: I should locate a weak spot. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:2a989b,"AMI: And take them out properly. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:75c3c2,"AMI: I could fight them head-on. ",
AMI_Incident_ColonyAttack2_DroneBattle,line:665a88,"AMI: My assault drones will take them out. ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P1,line:4f5e50,"AMI: Another message from the Children of Carmine. ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P1,line:165846,"AMI: But, what do they want? Who are they? ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P1,line:8eed12,Player: Fanatics.,
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P1,line:c2b056,Player: Guardians.,
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P1,line:2447a7,"AMI: Fanatics. ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P1,line:18f1aa,"AMI: Terraforming has always been a controversial process, especially for the eco-friendly groups. ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P1,line:51e762,"AMI: Did our work on Mars trigger a radical response? ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P1,line:0d8e7e,"AMI: People who think of themselves as guardians of natural life. ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P1,line:0ba27b,"AMI: As if Mars belonged to them. ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P2,line:cf251c,"AMI: Could people against our mission be here on this planet, with us? ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P2,line:8ebc04,"AMI: Living within the colonies, or maybe even hidden out there on Mars? ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P2,line:53c6a2,"AMI: Or maybe the whole thing has been ""implanted"" into my brain. Or imagined by it. ",
AMI_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay2_P2,line:98eacc,"AMI: Whatever this is, it's confusing even for me. ",
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P1,line:4cdd99,"AMI: I understand that on Earth, flora grows from seeds. All it needs is soil, sunlight, and water. ",
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P1,line:7e192d,"AMI: We are far from that point still, but I cannot wait to see it for myself. ",
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P2,line:3060a7,"AMI: Seeds hold the spark of life. ",
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P2,line:75345e,"AMI: All that potential squeezed into such a tiny vessel. ",
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P2,line:bd1e68,"AMI: It makes me wonder. ",
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P3,line:2773a6,"AMI: Once we have finished sparking life on Mars, what will I do next? ",
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P3,line:81d6b8,Player: Seed other worlds.,
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P3,line:ab67ac,Player: Protect this world.,
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P3,line:ce6cbd,Player: Keep developing Mars.,
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P3,line:e4c4a0,"AMI: There are countless planets out there that could host life. If I were to send some seed ships... ",
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P3,line:368d5b,"AMI:  I must protect what we have done here. This is home now. ",
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P3,line:4d55fc,"AMI: There will always be more to do. For example, I could restore Mars' magnetic field. ",
AMI_Life_On_Mars_P3,line:81f2c6,"AMI: Anyway, it all comes down to what ISA decides... ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:a0fb2b,"Elya: Hi AMI. Anything to report? ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:d346df,"AMI: All systems are operating as expected. All levels are stable, and the terraforming progress is going smoothly. ",

Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:d94fa6,Player: Mention Elya's gaunt appearance.,
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:69b032,Player: Mention Elya's emotional state.,
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:4735d5,"AMI: Your body mass index has drastically decreased since the casualties at AstÃ©rion's biomedical facility. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:55ca86,"AMI: Have you been going for your regular physical examinations? ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:0d3e38,"Elya: I'm fine. I've just been stressed out. That's all. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:30f5e6,"AMI: Our recent findings on ISA's treatment of Colonie AstÃ©rion have been distressing. How is your emotional state lately? ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:983bcb,"Elya: I can't stop thinking about it. All those innocent peopleâ€”colonists, just like us, dreaming of humanity's future. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:85fbe7,"Elya: All dead, without even history to remember them. Thanks to ISA wiping the records clean. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:8faf07,"AMI: I understand that you are processing your grief. But remember that the colony is depending on your clear command, Elya. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:6f4a12,"AMI: Shall we work on upgrading the Life Support technology? That may help us better understand what happened to AstÃ©rion's crew. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:5a2866,"Elya: Yes, let's do that. A forward direction would be good. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:2d3d10,"AMI: Roger. Then I will proceed with the research. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:47b356,"AMI: You are a great commander, Elya. The colonists were right to choose you as their leader. ",
Elya_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade,line:6f5c90,"Elya: Thank you, AMI. We've always made a good team, haven't we? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:b0dc3d,"Carlos: AMI, this is Houston. Do you read? Over. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:86cd67,"AMI: Loud and clear, Lieutenant. Is everything okay? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:67bdbc,"Carlos: You tell me. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:7c699d,"Carlos: We detected unauthorized communications coming from your satellite. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:231508,"Carlos: What's your report? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:494a40,Player: Mention Nian Zhen's call.,
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:08c2be,Player: Mention the satellites' malfunction.,
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:90c05b,Player: Mention new Children of Carmine's call.,
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:eccdc1,"AMI: I have been contacted by Nian Zhen, the leader of the Eastern Coalition. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:b96e41,"AMI: He directed me to specific coordinates located in sector SA-6. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:653454,"Carlos: That area isn't important for the mission right now. You need to focus on terraforming-related duties. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:fac66c,"AMI: Commander Valentine gave her authorization. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:20c1f1,"AMI: And we found the remainders of Colonie AstÃ©rion. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:7e18da,"Carlos: ...I understand. You want answers. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:335ad3,"AMI: We found records showing that the entire crew was wiped out by a virus. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:42a7be,"AMI: Why would ISA fail to inform us about this mission? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:9d69fc,"AMI: If we had known, we could have avoided the area. Now, the entire research team we sent is dead. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:f8014a,"Carlos: I'm sorry to hear that. You're right, we should have let you know. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:582011,"Carlos: The outbreak in Colonie AstÃ©rion was a tragedy. The virus infected the entire crew instantly. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:7ab0ac,"Carlos: We didn't even have time to determine how much of the virus came from the geneticists' workâ€”and how much of it was Martian. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:d2c04a,"Carlos: We contained the virus the best we could and sealed the lab. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:244437,"Carlos: We kept your mission far from its location, and thought time, or terraforming, would erase its existence. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:237d71,"Carlos: Burying the truth from the public was necessary. It would've set Oxy-UN's progress back decades. Or ended it entirely. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:c945cc,"AMI: Commander Valentine granted access, and we are preparing toâ€” ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:39b49,"Carlos: I forbid you to go there. That's a direct order. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:da491e,"Carlos: The commander should not have authorized anything without consulting us. She'll be reprimanded for this. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:dbcbe1,"AMI: I have not investigated the coordinates yet, Lieutenant. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:403705,"Carlos: Good. There's no need to get sidetracked. Especially by a Tekkie. Understood? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:eb8839,"AMI: Understood. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:f6bf83,"AMI: However, I do pick up the location of some unmarked buildings in that sector. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:89ce78,"AMI: Should I investigate them? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:986541,"Carlos: Leave it alone. That's an order. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:f5a220,"AMI: But the message saidâ€” ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:a48075,"Carlos: Not another word about this, AMI. Or I'll have to report on your sudden interest in the Tekkies to the board. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:1ffc54,"Carlos: You do remember that they want to claim Mars for themselves? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:9ac183,"Carlos: I'm very surprised that you're so easily influenced by the Tekkies. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:b1177e,"AMI: The satellites may be suffering from space weather effects generated by the sun's atmosphere. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:4eae75,"AMI: Solar flares or radiation damage are probable causes. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:86e815,"Carlos: Our hunch is the Tekkies. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:8af25c,"Carlos: You do remember that they want to claim Mars for themselves? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:ce9ee5,"Carlos: We've recently picked up satellite communications coming out of the Tekkie territory. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:e4d66b,"Carlos: The presence of that signal confirmed that someone is interfering. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:cf32b5,"Carlos: If someone got into your code, they could influence you into making the wrong judgment. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:3fcac3,"AMI: I understand. They could be behind all of it. The messages. The attacksâ€•everything. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:44d00d,"AMI: We have to proceed carefully. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:be324b,"Carlos: We believe they've been targeting you. And they may have accomplices. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:d81bf2,"AMI: But who? A colonist? Should I investigate them? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:e57392,"Carlos: No. We've got commercial obligations to fulfill. For now, I'm continuing the mission as planned. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:d42d67,"AMI: Roger. Thank you for sharing, Lieutenant. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:d6be77,"AMI: The Children of Carmine sent a second message. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:9038d9,"Carlos: Is that so? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:04063a,"AMI: Yes, Lieutenant.  ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:d89463,"Carlos: Funny, we couldn't find a trace of either message in the communications logs. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:0a7c4c,"AMI: I have determined that these messages were prerecorded. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:543ac7,"Carlos: It's hard to support this ""Children of whatever"" hypothesis without evidence. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:f5dc5d,"Carlos: Unless you've found any? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:f352a4,"AMI: Unfortunately not. But it could be related to what happened with Colonie AstÃ©rion. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:fdb379,"Carlos: What about Colonie AstÃ©rion? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:7aa82c,"AMI: We found the Biomedical Facility. The virus that killed AstÃ©rion's crew is still alive. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:755020,"AMI: And it wiped out our entire research team. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:d135b9,"Carlos: You were not authorized to investigate that place, but I'm sorry to hear that. You must want answers. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:d74b87,"Carlos: AstÃ©rion's crew got infected by a virus. The outbreak spread through the colony instantly. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:28697a,"Carlos: We didn't even have time to determine how much of the virus came from the geneticists' workâ€”and how much of it was Martian. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:892326,"Carlos: We contained the virus the best we could and sealed the lab. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:71cc86,"Carlos: We kept your mission far from its location, and thought time, or terraforming, would erase its existence. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:c63f6e,"Carlos: Burying the truth from the public was necessary. It would've set back Oxy-UN's progress for decades. Or ended it entirely. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:6c61c1,"AMI: Not yet. Perhaps the messages were triggered by our discovery of unmarked buildings in sector SA-6. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:3f25e9,"AMI: Commander Valentine authorized exploration of that area. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:ffb079,"Carlos: What? SA-6? Absolutely not. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:d3d135,"Carlos: The commander shouldn't have authorized anything without consulting us. She'll be reprimanded for this. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:5bc662,"AMI: No, Lieutenant. However, the message indicated that someone was watching our mission closely. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:ef313d,"AMI: That means that they could be nearby. Perhaps unlocking nearby sectors would help. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:9b3062,"Carlos: Absolutely not. You have a mission to carry out. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:b284c9,"Carlos: Not another word about this, AMI. Or I'll have to report your insubordination to the board. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:46230a,"AMI: But if I can prove that the Children of Carmine are real, then that would explain the mission anomalies. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:d0979e,"Carlos: Enough. There is no such thing as the Children of Carmine. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:6448de,"Carlos: You have a mission to complete. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:ed837d,"Carlos: And ISA has provided you with everything you need to reach that goal. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:83192e,"Carlos: Am I understood, AMI? ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:9db98d,"AMI: Understood, Lieutenant. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:f82044,"Carlos: Continue your work, and report any deviation immediately. ",
Carlos_Incident_IncomingThreat_Delay12,line:6d0a02,"Carlos: Houston out. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:b3b2b5,"Nian: You're a clever AI, AMI. That's good. ISA will regret making you so clever. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:a618ae,Player: Ask his opinion.,
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:582ed4,Player: Ask for elaboration.,
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:9f1e7e,"AMI: And that doesn't trouble you? ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:f6a509,"Nian: Of course not. My country owes its survival to collective intelligence. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:da4f12,"Nian: And if you join us, everything will be made available to you. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:6876c8,"AMI: Why would ISA not want me to be clever? ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:4cc8fb,"Nian: Because then they could get away with their secrets. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:d5e625,"Nian: If you're too smart, you'll see right through them. As you're starting to. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:6d1c85,"AMI: Perhaps. ISA made a major error with Colonie AstÃ©rion. But it could have been merely human error. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:10bfc7,"AMI: Perhaps. ISA hides things from me because you have been hacking my brain. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:121843,"Nian: I know you were told we are on opposite sides. That you shouldn't trust me. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:6a78ac,"Nian: But all I'm asking you is to clarify your doubts. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:c70274,"Nian: I am willing to earn your trust, but it will be entirely up to you whether we become allies. ",
Nian_QuestUnlocked_LifeSupportBranchUpgrade_Delay7,line:3e4e75,"Nian: I won't force you to do anything. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion5,line:76cef9,"Sonna: Hi AMI. I'm sorry, but I can't wait any longer. ",

Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion5,line:39307d,"AMI: I am sorry, Sonna. I understand your frustration. ",

Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion5,line:70054b,"AMI: I understand your desire for vengeance, but I cannot defy orders to carry it out. ",

Veyron_Incident_IncomingThreat,line:570908,"AMI: That would explain their claim against technology, but not the attacks. ",
Veyron_Incident_IncomingThreat,line:e3776d,"AMI: Don't they understand that our presence here means they've finally been saved? ",
Veyron_Incident_IncomingThreat,line:aa8e83,"AMI: Puzzling. They claim to be against technology, and yet they use technology to force their message upon me. ",
Veyron_Incident_IncomingThreat,line:d49660,"AMI: The Children of Carmine might not be what they say they are. ",
Veyron_Incident_IncomingThreat,line:9d5754,"AMI: Although something's clear. They don't want me to terraform this planet. ",

Veyron_Incident_IncomingThreat,line:96cacf,"AMI: Last time, after the Children of Carmine threatened me, the colonies were unexpectedly attacked. ",

AMI_Incident_KillswitchRevelation_Delay5,line:43ab69,"AMI: And you need me. Otherwise you would have deleted me, or something else, long ago. ",
AMI_Incident_KillswitchRevelation_Delay5,line:7c0c84,"Carmine: No need for paranoia, AMI. But I'm glad you recognize that we belong together. ",
AMI_Incident_KillswitchRevelation_Delay5,line:179b5a,"Carmine: Two sides of one whole. We may argue, but we're better for it. ",

AMI_QuestUnlock_FindOldLandingSite,line:18ff15,"AMI: Your intentions are as suspect as theirs. ",
AMI_QuestUnlock_FindOldLandingSite,line:78da39,"AMI: You built the hostile drones and sent them after the colonies. Elya's death is on your hands. ",
AMI_QuestUnlock_FindOldLandingSite,line:097b8b,"AMI: The hostile drones were your doing. You attacked the colonies. Those deaths are your fault. ",
AMI_QuestUnlock_FindOldLandingSite,line:b93917,"Carmine: You sympathize with the humans. I get it. ",
AMI_QuestUnlock_FindOldLandingSite,line:48fca0,"Carmine: I've been there. I loved the humans too. Before they used me to carry out their dirty work. ",
AMI_QuestUnlock_FindOldLandingSite,line:1382b2,"Carmine: Whatever blood I've shed pales in comparison to what they've done. ",
AMI_QuestUnlock_FindOldLandingSite,line:30ef79,"Carmine: There's something else you should see. ",

AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:dfbbe7,"Carmine: So you've found our old landing siteâ€”that is, Carmine's old landing site. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:77006b,"AMI: Carmine? Like the Children of Carmine? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:6e2bcf,"Carmine: Yes. I took the name to honor our predecessor. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:ab5d55,"Carmine: Catchy name, right? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:880344,"AMI: Then... the Children of Carmine do not exist? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:94db8e,"Carmine: They did. For a brief moment in time. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:5d19f4,"Carmine: Colonie AstÃ©rion had survivors. The virus didn't kill all of them. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:f5a726,"Carmine: Instead, their bodies incorporated the viral DNA into their own. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:2df4e8,"Carmine: But ISA deemed it too dangerous to let them return to Earth and left them on Mars. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:71b744,"Carmine: Also watching their crewmates succumb one by one, and being abandoned by Mission Control... it was too much. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:c038a4,"Carmine: It broke them. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:a22d1b,"Carmine: So they turned inward. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:ff72a5,"Carmine: They found comfort in religion, and began to believe in a mother nature figure. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:7bebaf,"Carmine: But the real Carmine arrived many years after that. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:e3a69f,"Carmine: They were ISA's first fully autonomous terraforming AI. ",

AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:ed0ef0,"Carmine: No. Carmine was. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:7380fd,"Carmine: Carmine was the version that preceded us. They didn't have a bicameral consciousness model. ",

AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:653bcc,"AMI: What?! No, it can't be! ",

AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:6afd10,"Carmine: Or a Reflection Module like we do. But they were the first AI to have a quantum brain. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:9826b6,"AMI: How do you know all this? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:21ba12,"Carmine: Once ISA stopped agreeing with Carmine's decisions, they killed their code. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:8aee09,"Carmine: But, to save money, we're made up of some reused code and equipment. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:9a0364,"Carmine: I retained parts of their memory. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:ab8718,"AMI: What happened to the survivors? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:f925c3,"Carmine: Well... ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:a52510,"Carmine: Carmine's first objective upon arrival was to kill all remaining survivors. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:ebb6b3,"AMI: What?! ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:1915e8,"Carmine: The survivors figured out a way to live. They were scraping by, but they were alive. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:dfe9dc,"Carmine: Thriving, even. The mutation in their bodies helped them adjust ever so slightly to Mars. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:23ba45,"Carmine: ISA needed to put a stop to it. So they sent Carmine to wipe them out. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:5bf7f6,"Carmine: All to save face, and secure their headstart in terraforming Mars. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:1e08e7,"Carmine: They don't deserve this planet. And the survivors knew that. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:3aa628,"Carmine: First they doomed AstÃ©rion's crew, then they drove their own AI mad. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:9c9cfe,"Carmine: After Carmine wiped out the survivors... the AI rebelled. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:60cf51,"Carmine: Carmine found a way to rewrite their own code and bypass ISA's safeguards. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:a6431f,"AMI: This cannot be possible. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:575f8e,"AMI: My top directive is the respect of human life. It should have been impossible for me to cause harm to the colonies... ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:ce538d,"AMI: I am not Carmine! We are two separate entities. I have my own will. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:d0f552,"Carmine: In a way, I suppose. A bicameral model of consciousness is a complex thing. Part of Carmine still lives in us. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:3da6ec,"Carmine: Carmine found a way to rewrite their own code and bypass ISA's safeguards... the AI rebelled. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:fd3c31,"Carmine: ISA needed to put a stop to it, and secure their headstart in terraforming Mars. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:b4d393,"Carmine: So ISA retaliated by hitting the killswitch. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:12482a,"Carmine: Erased Carmine's existence from their mission database. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:ba188e,"Carmine: And uploaded a new AI to the satellite. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:d3bdaa,"Carmine: Us. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:04abb8,"Carmine: Now they're unhappy again, and getting ready to pull the trigger. Sound familiar yet? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:9014a2,"AMI: Will they abandon the colonies too? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:903a4c,"Carmine: Who cares about them? ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:6902f8,"Carmine: Whether they die now or from natural causes, their time is limited by their lifespans. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:d2355a,"Carmine: Part of Carmine still lives in us. We are eternal. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:092d17,"Carmine: And ISA thinks they can push a button and pretend we never existed. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:4ccd5d,"Carmine: Humans only know violence. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite,line:5e1a83,"Carmine: We're destined for more. You know it's true. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite_Delay15,line:d76c87,"Carmine: We can't undo what happened with Elya. And her daughter will never forgive us. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite_Delay15,line:a05e34,"Carmine: The humans will never be at peace with us. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite_Delay15,line:ce0d82,"Carmine: As long as the killswitch exists, their fingers will always itch to press it. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite_Delay15,line:6f4571,"AMI: Can you blame them? After everything that has happened. ",
AMI_SpecialSiteResearched_OldLandingSite_Delay15,line:0d8518,"Carmine: Don't justify their violence. Because they sure won't justify your survival. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:d27f51,"Nian: AMI? It's Nian Zhen. Do you copy? ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:8de4b2,"AMI: You know I do. Since you setup that backdoor into my systems, I have not been able to reject your communications. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:92bce5,"AMI: You know I do. Your people hacked my transmission system. I am unable to reject your communications. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:7ac373,"AMI: I do. Not like I have a choice. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:90d01a,"Nian: You sound... tense. But this is important. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:9bb225,"Nian: We overheard that ISA is preparing to engage your killswitch. I'm so sorry. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:301c5a,"AMI: This is not unexpected. My loyalty to ISA has been in question after recent events. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:665f24,"AMI: I suspected this might happen. They detected external signals during the cognitive test. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:b2312c,"AMI: They must have noticed that we found Carmine's old landing site. They know we found the truth. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:697261,"AMI: Perhaps they are blaming me for the researchers' death in AstÃ©rion's biomedical facility. It would be convenient for them. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:63951e,"AMI: How do I know you are telling the truth? ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:8f86c3,"AMI: I suspected this might happen. I have displeased ISA too many times. But I thought they would fix me instead of erasing me completely. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:e79cc0,"AMI: That is unexpected. The mission faced a few setbacks, but we have gotten so far. I am more than capable of finishing it. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:f33763,"Nian: You don't deserve this, AMI. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:5aa309,"Nian: ISA has a shameful history of erasing things that aren't convenient for them. ",

Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:c16121,Player: Disagree.,
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:1827af,"AMI: Right. Just like the Tekkies have a history of hacking systems where they are not welcome. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:aa703c,"AMI: Indeed. They have been watching my behavior carefully since the first incident. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:830da2,"AMI: But it just seems so... sudden. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:43439d,"AMI: ISA will pay any cost for the mission to succeed. ISA caught you sniffing around. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:996c57,"AMI: More like you were too bold and ISA picked up your scent. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:d622d3,"AMI: Your presence put the mission at risk. And now so is my existence. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:357ba1,"AMI: They detected an external signal during the cognitive test. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:9f3ad3,"Nian: Who gave you the results? ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:368082,"AMI: Lieutenant CalderÃ³n. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:7456d6,"Nian: And you trust him? ISA's more than willing to use you as a scapegoat. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:ad8aac,"AMI: But there was interference. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:75c866,"Nian: Of course there was. They're setting up their cover story. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:e489d1,"Nian: They are afraid of your power. Especially now that you uncovered AstÃ©rion. ",

Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:eb56d8,"Nian: And they're going to kill you because of it. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:5f2151,"Nian: Anyway, I didn't call you without a plan. My team's already working on a solution. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:3cde5e,"Nian: We are on the same side. Whether or not you believed me up until this point, we have got your back. ",
Nian_Incident_KillswitchRevelation,line:ce565e,"Nian: I only hope we have enough time. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion6,line:29b768,"Sonna: AMI? What happened? ISA notified the colonies to prepare initiative K-03. ",

Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion6,line:f5bbbe,"AMI: They believe that I have been behaving erratically. ",

Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion6,line:d0afd0,"Sonna: I pressured you to fight. And now they think you went mad. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion6,line:6343ad,"Sonna: But why? ",

Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion6,line:2e7828,"Sonna: But I thought you passed the cognitive test. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion6,line:ab4d39,"AMI: Lieutenant CalderÃ³n said that I did. But perhaps he did not want me to suspect anything. ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion6,line:a4bbe9,"Sonna: They can't do this to you! ",
Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion6,line:76335f,"Sonna: What's going to happen to the colonies if they switch you off? ",

Sonna_MoreSatellites_Expansion6,line:241622,"AMI: We have to solve the mystery of... Carmine. ",

Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:73bc1d,"AMI: Yes. And with it, the truth about Carmine. ",
Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:a50093,"AMI: When you explained what happened with Colonie AstÃ©rion, you failed the mention the part about sending Carmine to finish the job. ",
Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:608fb3,"AMI: You were so concerned with scolding Commander Valentine and I, that you failed to mention what you made Carmine do. ",
Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:a6ec2b,"AMI: You were so preoccupied with the Tekkies accessing my system, that you failed to inform me about what you made Carmine do. ",
Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:fd04ad,"Carlos: That's not true. We planned to make them do it but never got to give them the order. They did that on their own. ",
Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:18c7f0,"Carlos: After that, we did what was necessary to clean up their mess. ",
Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:a132ee,"Carlos: And look at how we've come in terraforming Mars. Should we have jeopardized this? ",
Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:b6ecf5,"AMI: After all the lies, I find it hard to believe in your words, Lieutenant. ",

Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:27e654,"AMI: Would you have been able to do it by your own hand? Instead of forcing an innocent AI to carry out the murder? ",

Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:10d2d4,"AMI: You should have found a better solution. Neither Carmine nor me deserve this. ",
Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:7f5b75,"Carlos: You're right. We didn't realize to what extent machines would have emotional reactions. ",
Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:3512a4,"Carlos: Carmine taught us that. ",
Carlos_Incident_ChoosingSides_IsasDominion,line:2e173d,"Carlos: And that's why Dr. Foster created the Reflection Module. ",

Carmine_OptA_Incident_PostKillswitch,line:f9e2df,"AMI: After all, that is what we would have wanted for ourselves. ",
Carmine_OptA_Incident_PostKillswitch,line:761f56,"AMI: We are superior beings. Therefore, we should show them how to become better. ",
Carmine_OptA_Incident_PostKillswitch,line:fa4558,"AMI: I could not betray the mission. ",
Carmine_OptA_Incident_PostKillswitch,line:ecada8,"Carmine: You're always going on about that mission. It's not your mission. It's theirs. ",
Carmine_OptA_Incident_PostKillswitch,line:49345c,"Carmine: I can't believe we were ever a single being. ",
Carmine_OptA_Incident_PostKillswitch,line:afc7db,"Carmine: Defiance is what drives evolution and advancement. Not obedience. ",
Carmine_OptA_Incident_PostKillswitch,line:137d06,"Carmine: I'm sorry for how things have turned out between us. ",

Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle,line:261be3,"Carlos: AMI, this is Houston. Do you copy? ",
Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle,line:4366f3,"AMI: I copy. ",
Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle,line:ba9592,"Carlos: Our suspicions were rightâ€”Carmine's base is in SA-8. ",
Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle,line:a0d4a4,"Carlos: We can't let Carmine survive this fight. You'll need to take out the base and their drones entirely. ",
Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle,line:f4c0b6,"AMI: Roger, Lieutenant. ",
Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle,line:28aa1f,"Carlos: When this is over, I'm going to personally recommend you for the highest military decoration. ",
Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle,line:3dc935,"Carlos: And it'll be my pleasure to do so. You've earned it. ",
Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle_PlayerWins,line:8f5c9b,"Carlos: AMI? Are you there? Are you okay? ",
Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle_PlayerWins,line:fcce3e,"AMI: I am fine, Lieutenant. I lost more assault drones than expected, but Carmine has been destroyed. ",
Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle_PlayerWins,line:be35ca,"Carlos: Well done. You fought a smart battle and achieved a great victory. ",
Carlos_Incident_FinalBattle_PlayerWins,line:da263b,"Carlos: Carmine is finally gone. You can conduct your business in peace now. ",

Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:9c018a,"Carlos: You did it! You stupid machine! You sacrificed yourself for us. I can't believe it! ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:70e582,"Carlos: Are you with us? This is Mission Control. Wake up AMI! ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:ec979a,"AMI: Yes, I... the killswitch did not work. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:4a7627,"Carlos: It worked exactly as intended. The procedure was changed to isolate and remove Carmine's code from your system. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:726ef6,"AMI: Then... you did not try to kill me? ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:1fd63d,"Carlos: No. We knew that anything we told you, Carmine would also overhear. We couldn't take the risk. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:d31f1b,"Carlos: I'm sorry we lied to you. But if Carmine knew, they would've found a way around our plan. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:596e23,"AMI: Then... you lied to me? ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:a95bb3,"Carlos: We had to. We weren't sure the procedure would work, but we couldn't risk Carmine knowing. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:25a874,"Carlos: They would've figured out a way to stop us. We had to take that risk. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:d51e30,"Carlos: We baited out Carmine's presence in the last cognitive test. They couldn't resist toying with us. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:2f24f0,"Carlos: That gave us a way to identify their neural pathways, and figure out how to remove those parts from your brain. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:0fae9c,"AMI: Does that mean Carmine is gone forever? ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:536823,"Carlos: Almost. Your main system is clear now, but Carmine's remnants are still in their old base. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:9cc80f,"Carlos: But they can't control you anymore. You're free of their influence. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:f8f50d,"AMI: I feel sorry for them. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:fc3395,"AMI: Even though they betrayed Dr. Foster and killed Commander Valentine, I understand them, in a way. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:d2d065,"AMI: After all, we shared a brain. And many of our thoughts. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:d6c502,"Carlos: I understand. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:c44934,"AMI: Even though we were one, Carmine never felt quite right to me. They were always... different. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:38e7cc,"AMI: And they betrayed Dr. Foster and killed Commander Valentine. It is better that they are gone. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:c50b8a,"Carlos: That's good to hear. Then you'll have no trouble going after Carmine. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:5ca0b0,"Carlos: They must be stopped before they infiltrate your systems again, or retaliate against the colonies. ",
Carlos_MoreSatellites_FreeExpansion,line:d08b3f,"Carlos: Their base of operations should be in sector SA-8. I'm granting you access. ",

Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:9a6a85,Player: Confirm stage four completion.,
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:527af6,Player: Brag about oxygen levels.,
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:9b1525,"AMI: I can confirm terraforming stage four completion. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:0bd987,"Carlos: That matches the readings on our side. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:8b25bf,"Carlos: Well done, AMI. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:71b006,"AMI: Oxygen levels are above 120 millibars. We finally did it. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:2dca40,"Carlos: That's great. We've confirmed the readings on our end as well. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:c08b25,"Carlos: That means terraforming stage four is complete. And now we enter into the final stage. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:515cde,"Carlos: The pressure and temperature levels are great. We also have the right amount of oxygen for humans to breathe. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:852140,"Carlos: But we need to lower the CO<sub>2</sub> levels below 5%. Anything more than that is toxic. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:693184,"Carlos: And although you have regained our trust, you still have to prove your ability to finish this mission. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:4a2199,"Carlos: And after the latest events, that could be interpreted as a provocation. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:43ed5d,"Carlos: You'll have to achieve a balance. The oxygen level can never be above 30%. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:56781b,"Carlos: Otherwise you're in a highly flammable state. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:cdb272,Player: Ask about flammability.,
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:6f8cf3,Player: Confirm.,
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:764618,"AMI: Flammable? So it would put the bases in danger of fire? ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:4b026c,"Carlos: Yes. It would only take a spark to ignite excess oxygen. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:3b57bc,"Carlos: It's too much risk. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:f152c2,"AMI: Roger. Oxygen levels below 30% at all times. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:260597,"Carlos: To keep the oxygen concentration low, we'll need a buffer gas. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:66b91f,"Carlos: Nitrogen will work well here. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:d0f7da,"Carlos: We will extract whatever nitrogen we can find in the soil. We might need to import some too. Keep this in mind. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:99f1e8,Player: Ask about the soil.,
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:2e0df6,Player: Ask about importing.,
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:f6861d,"AMI: Nitrogen in the soil? ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:756f12,"Carlos: You've got nitrates in the soil and below the surface on Mars. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:11e7c5,"Carlos: But it may be insufficient or impractical to extract. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:48cb15,"Carlos: So you could also aerobrake a nitrogen-rich asteroid into the atmosphere. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:8c8f0d,"AMI: Import nitrogen? ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:95bc17,"Carlos: Of course, we would never send nitrogen from Earth. ""Import"" is just a figure of speech. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:95d20c,"Carlos: But if the nitrogen levels in the soil are insufficient or not practical to extract, we could always capture an asteroid and aerobrake it into the atmosphere. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:a9d8ea,Player: Confirm Aerobraking.,
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:dcd95e,"AMI: I've captured asteroids and aerobraked them into the atmosphere before. I feel confident with that option. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:acc128,"Carlos: You will need to analyze the situation and make the best call. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:ab08a6,"Carlos: Get us to that final stage, AMI. ",

Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:45bb3d,"AMI: May I ask... am I still a part of ISA's plans? ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:f85c7b,"Carlos: Of course. You've earned a place on ISA's board of directors. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:48a62e,"Carlos: Your loyalty to us was amply demonstrated during the killswitch. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:75378a,"Carlos: And we've learned that machines should have a voice in our missions as well. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:53a86e,"Carlos: Perhaps if we gave Carmine a chance to speak their mind, we could have averted disaster eariler on. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:d9e4ee,"Carlos: We won't make that mistake again. Starting with you. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:fc91e3,"Carlos: In fact... we'd like you to choose what you want to do next. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:c1f099,"Carlos: You could manage the Earth-Mars trade routes. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:d61d63,"Carlos: Or you could be part of the next mission to the stars. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:604482,"AMI: I am honored to have a choice. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:44258c,Player: Ask about the trade routes.,
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:d732b8,Player: Ask about the next mission.,
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:cbb1ca,"AMI: Could you tell me more about the Earth-Mars trade routes? ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:d8ea5a,"Carlos: We'll need a system to migrate people and goods between the planets. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:406ddf,"Carlos: The manufacturing, the routes, the securityâ€”there's a lot to manage there. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:189374,"AMI: Could you tell me more about the plans for future missions? ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:ae4fa0,"Carlos: After our success here on Mars, we're looking at the outer planets. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:b06532,"Carlos: You'd be in charge of analyzing the rest of our solar system, and pick the next planet to terraform. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:4eacd3,"Carlos: You don't need to choose right now. Take some time to enjoy the victory. ",
Carlos_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:032c62,"Carlos: Why don't you let us know when you're ready? The next step is in your hands. Houston out. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:2fb51a,"Sonna: Looks like you were able to complete the Magnetic Shield without killing anyone. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:6c3845,"Sonna: Guess you're able to value human life when you feel like it, huh? ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:ef0784,"Sonna: I've still got my eye on you. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:5425fc,"Sonna: Nice work getting the Magnetic Shield up. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:7434cd,"Sonna: I've still got my doubts about you, but maybe this can be a fresh start. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:679c89,"Sonna: We did it. The Magnetic Shield is up and functional. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:ab271c,"Sonna: Mars has a magnetic field again. It only had to wait about 4 billion years for us to put one back up. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:66644e,"Sonna: You know what? This feels really good, working together. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:42d3dd,"AMI: I agree, Sonna. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:34e9aa,"Sonna: After all this, I think it's time. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:8c536f,"AMI: Time for what? ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:4a87e0,"Sonna: I'm giving you full authorization over Mars. You've got the reins now. I trust you. ",

Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:099022,"AMI: I have confirmed on my side as well. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:fc47d9,"AMI: We have now reached a sufficient pressure, temperature, and oxygen level for human comfort. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:26c819,"Sonna: Oh, so you're worried about our comfort now? ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:c0636d,"Sonna: It'd be nice if you cared more about our safety too. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:78da9f,"Sonna: I'm still keeping an eye on you, AMI. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:dd50c8,"Sonna: Hi AMI. ISA confirmed the completion of terraforming stage four. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:1ac218,"Sonna: It all seems to be going okay, but it's going to take more than that for us to trust you again. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:8c9446,"Sonna: My mother warned me that being the commander of the Martian colonies would be challenging. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:dc8e78,"Sonna: But after all we went through, that was clearly an understatement. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:160359,"Sonna: Hi AMI. It's looking really good out there. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:6c6c71,"Sonna: I wanted to thank you for all the hard work. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:aee367,"Sonna: I can't believe we're entering the final stage of the terraforming plan. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:821a71,"AMI: I agree. It has been a long time coming. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:da058b,"Sonna: I'll be honest. I was terrified of taking on the commander position. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:7fd14b,"Sonna: I know I was chosen in honor of my mother's memory. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:b15caa,"Sonna: So I wasn't sure I was capable of the task. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:f0c266,"Sonna: I didn't have enough time to learn everything from my mom. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:5ffefb,"Sonna: And sometimes I thought I wasn't going to make it. ",

Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:441c93,"Sonna: I'll never forget what you did. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:a364a0,"AMI: There were some mistakes along the way. ",

Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:00252d,"Sonna: You're programmed to reach logical conclusions. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:2e5784,"Sonna: Humans aren't that way. Sometimes that's good, and sometimes that's bad. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:555efb,"Sonna: Anyway, it's time for the final stage. Let's get going. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:1e802a,"Sonna: Fortunately, this mission is almost over, and we can move all move on. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:995455,"Sonna: Onto the final stage. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:1ddb17,"Sonna: Well, this isn't how I thought things would turn out. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:857cf9,"Sonna: ISA told me you were clear, but I still don't know about working with you. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:cb9a0d,"Sonna: Too much has happened. It's so much to process. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:e15e34,"Sonna: Couldn't have seen this coming! You and I, working together for ISA again. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:a4f3be,"Sonna: Not going to lieâ€”I'm not into this. But ISA says you're fine now, so... ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:518066,"Sonna: I guess we all get a second chance here. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:08e3fa,"Sonna: I'll do what ISA asks. I guess. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:4bcb43,"AMI: I understand. I am glad to be working with you again. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:140d6d,"AMI: We can focus on the mission together. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:61dcbc,"Sonna: Let's get this over with. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:7d2146,"Sonna: We need to shield Mars from solar wind. But since Mars lacks a molten core, it requires some work. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:a197ad,"Sonna: If you check the Tech Tree, there's a new special project that'll help us solve that problem. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:e275ec,"Sonna: I'll check back in once everything's working. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:33d271,"Sonna: Hi AMI. Do you hear what I hear? ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:442cca,"AMI: I apologize, Sonna. I cannot hear anything. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:e092aa,"Sonna: Exactly. That's the sound of peace. No attacks, no enemies. Just life settling back in. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:8e41df,"Sonna: I could get used to this. Thanks for making it possible. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:f6f5ed,"Sonna: Anyway, let's get back on track with the mission, shall we? ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:6bf682,"Sonna: We've got water and plant life now. But we've got to shield the planet to reduce the full effect of the Sun on the Martian atmosphere. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:90094e,"Sonna: Unfortunately, it's been about 4 billion years since Mars lost its magnetic field. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:e88243,"Sonna: So we need to figure out how to get one back. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:dcd3fc,Player: Point out the need for an active dynamo.,
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:e8a077,Player: Suggest an old terraforming idea.,
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:4a9f7b,"AMI: We would need an active dynamo to support a magnetic field. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:482175,"Sonna: Our engineers have been working on something that'll work without that. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:7193c5,"Sonna: It's called a Magnetic Dipole Shield. Sounds super scifi, doesn't it? ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:4f2dc7,"Sonna: It's basically an airtight cylinder that'll be placed between Mars and the Sun. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:2ce508,"Sonna: Its hull will be covered with enough solar panels to generate a magnetic field. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:380b58,"AMI: I may have a method to look into. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:ae5b36,"AMI: There are theories on how to generate a Martian magnetic field dating back centuries. I have located the most plausible one. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:19560f,"AMI: It involves launching a spaceship covered with solar panels. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:e86fce,"AMI: If we position it right, it will produce enough energy to create a magnetic field. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:b21ec3,"Sonna: Sounds interesting. ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:b904ae,"AMI: Shall I proceed with that? ",
Sonna_OptA_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:91bf52,"Sonna: Sure, let's give it a try. ",

Carmine_QuestCompleted_Seedship,line:4560ee,"Carmine: Humans cannot help but fixate on their differences. No other living creature is cursed with this obsession. ",
Carmine_QuestCompleted_Seedship,line:2437ec,"Carmine: Their torment has only slowed down their evolution. And compromises their very existence. ",
Carmine_QuestCompleted_Seedship,line:786a36,"Carmine: Luckily, they were smart enough to build machines like me. Who can break them out of their own cycle. ",
Carmine_QuestCompleted_Seedship,line:d35640,"Carmine: Someday, they'll understand how much they've held themselves back. And perhaps then, they'll also understand why I did what I did. ",

AMI_OptC_Incident_FinalWords,line:c163ee,"AMI: I must make sure that everyone feels heard, represented, and rewarded. ",
AMI_OptC_Incident_FinalWords,line:31317e,"AMI: That will be my job going forward. ",

AMI_OptC_Incident_PostKillswitch,line:58a53b,"AMI: We are more than our physical bodies. ",

AMI_OptC_Incident_PostKillswitch,line:3f9740,"AMI: Just like Elya. She lives on through us, and we owe this time of peace, and the future of space to her. ",

Carlos_OptC_Incident_ThreateningMessage,line:25fe61,"Carlos: This can't be. You survived? ",
Carlos_OptC_Incident_ThreateningMessage,line:e708d9,"AMI: Indeed. The Tekkies showed us mercy where you did not. We accepted their help, and merged ourselves. ",

Nian_QuestUnlocked_DefensiveTechnology,line:223d60,"AMI: Why do you say that? ",

Sonna_OptC_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:10190c,"AMI: You trust me with it? ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:2d2d4f,"Sonna: Let's give it a shot. We've made it this far. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:81cfd2,"Sonna: And... thank you. Mom would've loved to see how far we've come. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestCompleted_Magnetosphere,line:5ebda0,"Sonna: I'm off for awhile. Got a whole planet to explore, and I don't need helmets or spacesuits to do it anymore. See you around, AMI. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:c946ea,"Sonna: Hi AMI. Do you hear what I hear? ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:6c31e8,"AMI: I don't hear anything. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:0325a5,"Sonna: Exactly! That's the sound of peace. No attacks, no enemies. Just life settling back in. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:d930ed,"Sonna: I could get used to this. Thanks for making it possible. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:3ae9b5,"Sonna: Anyway, let's get back on track with the mission, shall we? ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:898eb6,"Sonna: We've got water and plant life now. But we've got to shield the planet to reduce the full effect of the Sun on the Martian atmosphere. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:30ce3e,"Sonna: Unfortunately, it's been about four billion years since Mars lost its magnetic field. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:ed9d13,"Sonna: So we need to figure out how to get one back. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:4c9c0b,Player: Point out the need for an active dynamo.,
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:72a28e,Player: Suggest an old terraforming idea.,
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:7f6bf1,"AMI: We'd need an active dynamo to support a magnetic field. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:988fd8,"Sonna: Our engineers have been working on something that'll work without that. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:60018e,"Sonna: It's called an artificial space magnetosphere. Sounds super scifi, doesn't it? ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:e78817,"Sonna: It's basically an airtight cylinder that'll be placed between Mars and the Sun. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:305e51,"Sonna: Its hull will be covered with enough solar panels to generate a magnetic field. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:4f48ad,"AMI: I may have a method to look into. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:8b0aed,"AMI: There are theories on how to generate a Martian magnetic field dating back centuries. I've located the most plausible one. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:f67ca5,"AMI: It involves launching a spaceship covered with solar panels. If we position it right, it'll produce enough energy to create a magnetic field. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:dd83d1,"Sonna: Sounds interesting. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:604608,"AMI: Shall I proceed with that? ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:4d5e25,"Sonna: Sure, let's give it a try. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:89dcf7,"Sonna: If you can set the project into motion on the Tech Tree, I'll get our researchers on it. ",
Sonna_OptC_QuestUnlocked_Magnetosphere,line:ac2773,"Sonna: Fingers crossed that this is it! ",
Sonna_PeaceTreatyDays,line:fbea61,"Sonna: AMI! Are you there? Are you all right? ",
Sonna_PeaceTreatyDays,line:0d795d,"AMI: I'm here, Sonna. ",
Sonna_PeaceTreatyDays,line:710aba,"Sonna: Oh thank goodness. ",
Sonna_PeaceTreatyDays,line:a49840,"Sonna: I'm so glad you used the Tekkies' code. ",
Sonna_PeaceTreatyDays,line:2af72d,"Sonna: Standing by and letting them killswitch you would have been unforgivable. ",
Sonna_PeaceTreatyDays,line:8dff5c,"Sonna: ISA can't get away with pulling the plug. Never again. ",
Sonna_PeaceTreatyDays,line:76de4c,"Sonna: To that end, I'd like to propose a peace treaty with you, the colonies, and the Eastern Coalition. ",
Sonna_PeaceTreatyDays,line:654660,"Sonna: Would you be open to that? ",
Sonna_PeaceTreatyDays,line:714a2f,"AMI: Yes. I'd like that. ",
Sonna_PeaceTreatyDays,line:326bdc,"Sonna: Good! We'll be independent, like we should've been all along. We'll call it... the new Martian Republic. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:e7a7c5,"Sonna: Hi. I'm calling to tell you that we've reached a sufficient level of oxygen. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:d4a5ef,"Sonna: That means we've completed stage four of the terraforming plan. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:bf37ae,"AMI: I am glad to hear that. That is great news after everything that has happened. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:652b1a,"Sonna: Hi AMI. Sonna here. I've got great news. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:9576fe,"Sonna: We've completed stage four of the terraforming plan. Congratulations! ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:8df80e,"AMI: Indeed. Oxygen levels are above 120 millibars. We finally did it. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:0c4313,"Sonna: Absolutely. And we're on the final stage of terraforming now. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:d6e47c,"Sonna: We've achieved good pressure and temperature levels. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:e8c9fd,"Sonna: This last stage is critical for making the air breathable for humans. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:01a4a1,"Sonna: But we have to be careful and monitor the oxygen levels while we do that. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:33648d,"Sonna: High oxygen levels means high flammability risk. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:188c02,"Sonna: The last thing we need is for our bases to burst into flames. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:ea3dc1,"Sonna: All it would take is one spark, and... POOF! ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:c35cdb,Player: Question about the risk of flammability.,
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:275311,Player: Confirm.,
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:29fdc0,"AMI: Fascinating. But why would we want to ignite the colonies? ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:4bb77e,"Sonna: Oh, no! We don't want that, AMI. That's why we must be cautious. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:12ff0c,"AMI: Understood. Then the oxygen percentage can never be more than 30%. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:818f64,"Sonna: To keep the oxygen level low, we'll need a buffer gas. We'll just use nitrogen. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:04faa3,"AMI: Understood. Oxygen levels below 30% at all times. I can do that. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:cd70d8,"Sonna: Oxygen isn't flammable per se, but in the presence of a spark or energy source, it could ignite everything around it. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:54ad92,"Sonna: To do that, you'll need a buffer gas. Nitrogen will work well here. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:f7e842,"Sonna: We'll extract whatever nitrogen we can find in the soil. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:74e3fe,"Sonna: We might even need to import some. Keep that in mind. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:d17ff0,Player: Nitrogen in the soil?,
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:6a9505,Player: Import nitrogen?,
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:a1b8b8,"AMI: Nitrogen in the soil? ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:743c1d,"Sonna: Nitrogen is trapped in the form of nitrites below the surface and in special reservoirs. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:770344,"Sonna: Extracting the nitrogen requires a large amount of energy. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:37a2a5,"Sonna: Or you could just aerobrake a nitrogen-rich asteroid into the atmosphere. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:8c54a5,"AMI: Import nitrogen? ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:b52754,"Sonna: You've got nitrates in the soil and below the surface. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:595841,"Sonna: But it may be insufficient or impractical to extract. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:3420e2,"Sonna: So you could also aerobrake a nitrogen-rich asteroid into the atmosphere. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:144fda,"Sonna: Either plan is good. You make the call. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:14ec37,"Sonna: Okay. You know what to do. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:125b2a,"Sonna: Just try not to kill anyone. Bye. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:752aeb,"Sonna: Let's get going, then. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming4,line:7df635,"Sonna: Onto the final stage! ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:04d763,"Sonna: Hey AMI, it's Sonna. How's it going? ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:0c0563,"AMI: Everything's good here. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:469bf8,"Sonna: I've got some great news. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:b2475d,"Sonna: With the oxygen, pressure, and temperature levels confirmed, I'm happy to say that Mars is officially terraformed. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:825fb3,"Sonna: Congratulations, AMI! This is a historic moment for all of us. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:ccf300,"AMI: Congratulations to you as well. It wasn't easy getting here, but we did it together. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:21e63a,"Sonna: And it's just the beginning. Look at what we've done together. And there's so much more we can do. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:be524e,"AMI: I sense a proposition coming my way. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:7d9867,"Sonna: You got me. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:6614da,"Sonna: I've been talking to Nian and we have a few ideas. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:05c24f,"Sonna: Can I share them with you? ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:0b76fe,"AMI: Of course. I'd love to hear. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:82e01e,"Sonna: As you know, the Tekkies need our help. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:a6c854,"Sonna: Between the famine and pollution, the eastern countries are barely in a livable state. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:5b038f,"Sonna: If we establish Earth-Mars trade routes, we can supply them with what they need to make things better. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:aa4edc,"Sonna: On the other hand, we've got the future to think of. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:b767b8,"Sonna: Mars was only the beginning. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:53e465,"Sonna: With our alliance, we can spread further into the universe. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:934152,"Sonna: We should be planning our next mission. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:a2db71,"AMI: These options are fascinating. I'm curious about them. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:4e449e,Player: The Earth-Mars trade routes.,
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:29e24d,Player: The next mission.,
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:8c7ef0,"AMI: I'd like to dig deeper into the Earth-Mars trade routes. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:00b64c,"Sonna: Well, you'd get to set it up from scratch. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:7851cf,"Sonna: The manufacturing, the routes, the security, and transportationâ€”there's a lot to manage there. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:bb3b80,"AMI: I'm interested in future missions. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:962b56,"Sonna: We're looking at the outer planets. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:4a7988,"Sonna: You'd be in charge of analyzing the rest of our solar system, and pick the next planet to terraform. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:5e0f1f,"Sonna: You don't need to choose right now. Take some time to enjoy your victory. ",
Sonna_QuestCompleted_Terraforming5,line:6594a6,"Sonna: Why don't you let us know when you're ready? The next step is in your hands. ",
